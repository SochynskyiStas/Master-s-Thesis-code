or is this a product of centuries of brainwash by society? humans by nature are selfish and competitive but it\\'s more of a survivor defense mechanism than anything, i think all the rest of the cruel values and selfishness that has been brainwashed into humanities minds and hearts is definitely a product of the masses. i especially know this since i use to be one of them, utterly brainwashed, hurting others never realizing it or the extent. but thankfully i always in the depths of my heart had that urge, that desire to be a better human being programmed into my heart even in the bigoted ways of my past.everybody lies, everyone lies. when i say that i don\\'t mean 100% i mean 80% the majority who far outweigh the few people you can run into who are apart of that other 20%, meaning it\\'s almost invisible. even that neighbor with his kids, loving wife, who wakes at 5am everyday to drink his coffee and goes to work, who smiles at you when he sees you in the morning and asks \"how you are?\" and bids a \"good day\" to you is some selfish prick who believes, who teaches and preaches these terrible values to his family thinking it\\'s normal, it\\'s alright, \"we\\'re the good ones\", \"we should be proud for being such upstanding citizens\" even that guy is a total selfish evil prick that goes blind to most of societies eyes.i don\\'t know how to live with myself anymore, i\\'ve tried for months to figure out a way to want to continue to live in what i know and feel.how can i integrate back into society knowing how they treats others? the racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality, how they treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism, nationalism, religious discrimination, linguistic discrimination, neurological descrimination. how most women treat most men now, they\\'re all evil. how transgender people treat cisgender people because \"they could never understand\" whelp they treated us this way so now \"stfu\" your cis you have no say you \"evil cis!\" it\\'s nothing but hate one way or the other, even the person fighting for what\\'s right is doing it by doing something so wrong, even if the person is good in your eyes there\\'s something dark and fucked up about them.i\\'m no saint but everyday i self-reflect, everyday i look at how i can improve as a human, i can do wrong and i can hurt, but i have the self-awareness to listen to my fellow human and learn from it and be better, to see my faults, where i can improve, because i can\\'t stand the thought of a stranger hurting because i had something to do with it directly or indirectly.let\\'s pollute, let\\'s kill our planet, let\\'s have plastic surgery for non-medical reasons, let\\'s hurt animals, let\\'s make more and more and more money, let\\'s bully in real life and on the internet, let\\'s have privilege, let\\'s eye for an eye, because if we suffered in the past i guess than those who oppressed should suffer now, even the innocent ones, so you\\'re fucked if you\\'re a man, or you\\'re white, or you\\'re christian, or jewish, or cisgender, or bisexual, or or or or or or. let\\'s not be educated, let\\'s think we learned so much and enough, we shouldn\\'t have to be taught better anymore, because \"we know better\".why is there so much risk to living a new day everyday even if you\\'re mildly successful?if i\\'m bisexual, my sexuality will probably get dismissed left and right all day.if i\\'m gay i better not be somewhere like lithuania.if i\\'m transgender, well i\\'ll have to look over my shoulder and fear for my life 68% of the time while never being taken seriously as my gender.if i\\'m cisgender, well you better get use to the fact you\\'re \"evil\" because i guess i had a conventional upbringing.if i\\'m religious, well that\\'s all hocus pocus now, you\\'re beliefs are secondary to mines!if you\\'re unattractive, best get use to the idea you\\'ll never get taken completely seriously, you\\'ll have to work and prove yourself 20 times more to other people and probably still not get as good as a opportunity.if you\\'re a woman, hope you love that unequal salary and being slut-shammed for wearing a skirt or shorts one size too small and tight.if you\\'re shorter than 5\\'7, good luck in the dating world, ha good luck getting that job because statistically taller people are hired more and valued more.if you have tattoos, get ready for those stereotypes and awkward looks of judgement.if you\\'re \"fat\", guess what you\\'re lazy.if you\\'re too skinny, remember women love fits guys and men love voluptuous ladies!if you\\'re not making at least 100k, might as well die, you\\'re like that crap that went on clearance at a dollar store nobody wants and will go salvage.if you\\'re bi-polar, have ptsd, depressed, on the spectrum and many of the other frequent and normal neurological conditions everyone suffers normally daily in society, all those immensely gorgeous models, those intellectually genius people, all those successful and wealthy people who have those conditions, no one bats an eye to them, because if you have an issue and your worth doesn\\'t translate to instant money, well you\\'re just a fucked up person, a waste. doesn\\'t matter if you came from a violent background, homelessness, starvation, pain, a violent family, a history of prejudice. the older you are the more you better have your shit together! because money, looks, degrees, that shit is just handed to you like bubblegum from a candy dispenser apparently.fuck you for telling me it\\'ll get better, you mean if i somehow manage another week, or year, or 2 or 3 without fucking completely losing it mentally and going insane or offing myself because that\\'s how psychological distress works, it gets the best of you.it\\'ll get better alright, when a gosh damn existential miracle happens that magically makes most people not shit even when they\\'re \"good people\" who \"mean well\", when i\\'m not oppressed every damn waking second because i had no freaking say in my birth!eat it bitch survival of the fittest. thank you humanity you have passed a beautiful legacy to our society. the hippies of back then had it all right, peace and love all ya\\'ll. but those hippies were just a bunch of potheaded wastebags and their little mantra didn\\'t translate to selfishness and money.thank you so much.', tags=[8]),\n",

       " TaggedDocument(words=\"my life feels like a sham. i am 23 years old working basically a dead end job that i have no desire to work in. my original plans were to use my undergraduate to get into professional school but i can't get into any of them so i am on the verge of giving up on those. i probably don't have any aspirations to be in the field i am in but with my parents pressuring me to go into this field, i felt as though i had no other option. i have no real hobbies other than playing mobile games, watching tv/netflix/youtube and eating.i have a few friends but the relationships now feel surface level. i don't know if i could muster up the courage to tell them the extent of my depression. we have discussed bits and pieces of it, but never fully in depth. while the other friendships i have are mainly just hanging out playing video games, talking about music and getting high off weed, that's about it. i find no real joy in things anymore. the activities and things i do try, only remind me of how much of a fuck up i am because of my lack of life experience.growing up and currently i am an introvert. my family almost encouraged it becaus i feel as though they didn't know what else to do. i'm not sure how it all started if i'm being honest. it would be so bad that gatherings and social issues events where i didn't know people, i would pretend i was having nausea and hide in the washroom the whole time. man, as i'm typing this, i'm just really ashamed at what i've become. over the past few years i've tried to rectify these behaviors and i have seen improvements here and there (i don't hide in the bathroom anymore). however what i'm going to talk about next is probably one of the major reasons why i'm sad.so in the 23 years of my life, i've never had a real relationship before. there have been moments i go to the club or try online dating where i flirt, but that's the extent of my romantic life. introversion feeding into my depression has basically paralyzed my mind. everytime i want to flirt, i switch into a different mode and act shy. at the same time, i try to avoid romance for reasons i've said previous. i'm very depressed with my life and what it's come down to. i don't like the job or the field that i've been planning to do all my life. i have no real hobbies or passions outside of sitting on my ass at home, nor have i developed any real skills. they say confidence is key when approaching women, but my self-esteem is shot to rock bottom and i can never find enough courage to bring myself to ask a girl on a date. on top of that, what happens when i do ask and she says yes, where do we go from there? i have family that is christian but over the past few years i probably align myself as b in agnostic. because of this, i don't really mesh well with my family and their friends since i'm thinking of completely different perspective. i still live my family and i love them so much, but i realize that this is not helping my situation. all i know is that it's going to take me a long time to save up and move out somewhere.speaking of moving out, i make terrible financial decisions. i spend money frivolously on entertainment and food. i also masturbate way too frequently which i know interferes with things such as my social and love life. i'm about 30 lbs over the ideal weight for my age and height but have no resolve or willpower to work out. i've had braces a few times and never ended up keeping the retainers so i still have crooked teeth. i feel like a fuck up every time i look into the mirror because of that. that is something i know i have to life with until i get the money to fix them myself.that's the other thing about myself. if you haven't noticed by now, a lot of things i want to start or quit, i've never been able to. my will power and resolve is also rock bottom. i've tried working out, stopping masturbating, keeping straight teeth, you name it, i've never committed to anything. i don't know what is wrong with me, i can't keep myself going for more than a week befor relapsing before going back to old ways.my family has started to notice how mad and sad ive become but have no real suggestions. my parents continually push me towards the field that i have no desire to pursue. i know they mean well, they want me to able to live well within my means. i also know things would be much different growing up in their shoes moving from india to make a better life for themselves and our family. but with that being said, my family doesn't understand how important mental health is for someone. my father treats my mother like absolute crap nowadays, but my mother is too worried about indian cultures and traditions to do anything about it. my father has always cared about us but my mother has been a different story and i see it killing my mother inside. again wee are christian indians and while it's not unheard of, it is certainly looked down upon. the sad thing is my mother would rather be in this marriage then to live out her days alone. that type of mentality devastates me and i could never possibly resonate with me. hey it's easy for me to say never being in a relationship but i hope this behaviour isn't condoned regardless. so how could i possibly tell them the extent of my depression?my life has been set up for me to live a nice and comfortable existence. however, ive managed to fuck that up every possible way down this long road. ive never thought about seriously ending it all, but the thought has come up on multiple occasions. i know my family would be heartbroken if they were to find out something like that happened, so i guess there's one reason to live. haven't considered therapy or drugs until now but i'm probably going to go once the new year begins. all i'm seeking now is a road to happiness somehow.\", tags=[98]),\n",

my dad wanted us to live together out of fear for his mother's health and not knowing what accusations or stories to believe, my mom hated the way she was being made to feel in the house and the way her actions were being lied about. little incidents began being blown way out of proportion on both sides, there were some pretty huge fights. i lived with my mom's parents for a while (i love them, and have a deep bond with them). i wasn't a go-between for my parents, not then, but i knew i was still in the middle of their arguments. they wondered if the divorce would still have fallen through if i had not existed. but i knew they both loved me more than anything, and that was all that mattered.and then my brother came along - a somewhat late miracle. he's nine years younger than i am, and with him came a move to another city where the four of us could finally live together by ourselves, and things seemed to be better - at least on the surface. another move, and things seemed to be looking up, because my parents only really ever fought about was this woman. i finished school, started college, was somewhat reasonably happy that my parents weren't fighting as much anymore. my priority became to make sure my brother knew a loving home, where our parents didn't just love us with all their heart but also loved each other.then this year, my dad had to move back to the original city we're from, and i didn't want that to happen. but it did. and now we're back to square one, seemingly, except square one looks a lot scarier now that i'm no longer blind to every little thing that angers them. my mother's going through menopause at the moment, but she's more of a physical slave to her mil's more and more obscure household demands than ever. she's depressed because she doesn't see how much longer this can continue, this life that she isn't living for herself. my father's unable to understand why we can't all just get along and be one big happy family, but then again he's at work all day, and when he's home his mother behaves differently. for her part, my mom's mil doesn't want to live with us; she thinks she has enough money to live alone, even though she claims she's too sick to even move on most days. my brother, thankfully, doesn't care about this ridiculous and unnecessary soap opera drama. that leaves me.my parents now confide in me when i beg them for an explanation as to why they look so distressed and harried all the time. they've never badmouthed each other to me, but i can see more clearly now how unhappy this marriage has actually been, and how afraid they both are that the next 20 years will be the same muddled mess the last 20 have been. i wish i hadn't asked for explanations, and i feel guilty that i wish i were even more removed from it all than i already am. i'm on campus in another city for half the year, but whenever i come home it's to a negative, toxic, depressed atmosphere that makes sure my determination to be positive goes down the drain. i feel angry and ready to snap, too, even though i have no reason to be. i feel guilty for leaving my parents in this situation for half the year, and for enjoying myself even a bit when i'm out because i know how sad they often are back home. i just want this to be over. i want a solution to this problem. i find myself wishing my grandma would hurry up and die, and there's a dark thought i didn't think i'd be voicing out loud but here we are. if people i love, like my other grandma and my aunt, can die before their time surely people i dislike can also disappear. i know it's wrong to feel this way, and i tell myself to buck up and be normal whenever i'm depressed enough about the situation to think this.it's not so bad as i'm making it out to be. there have been plenty of good moments - in their marriage, and certainly us kids have never once doubted how united they are in doing their best for us. but i want it to be like that *all the time*. i want that happy family life. i don't want this sadness, and i certainly don't want to be the one aware of the massive failure in communication that occurs very often. and then i think i'm wrong for feeling that way. basically, i'm a huge mess.**tl;dr** my mom's mil is a horrible person, nothing will ever change, my parents are stuck in a vicious cycle that is making them - and me - miserable, and i don't know how i can get myself out of this funk.\", tags=[112]),\n",

just with simple \"memes\" (images with text) comparing him to dr. disrespect (one of the biggest twitch streamers who admited publicly he cheated om his wife,  and had the balls to stoo streaming to solve his issues). i criticized my friend for only caring about the money and putting that over his girlfriend that loves him more then everything even after he cheated on her... what happened next was: he blocked me everywhere instead of asking me why i did such thing,  since he didn\\'t did that,  i asume that i asume that i wasn\\'t a friend for him anymore, and decided to run away and delete me from everywhere. the thing is now everyone knows what type of person he his, and let them know if someone with even more money comes,  they can be left behind. but since now my ex friend doesn\\'t want to lose his funding (since he now lives from donations makong it a full time job). i don\\'t want the other to happen what happened to me... am i regreted of what i done? nope! the only \"if\"  point here was how his girlfriend reacted after i did this... i clearly see that she was sad,  and things could have been solved other way without exposing his life,  which i disagree, i exposed one thing about his life,  so the way she meant was the life as a whole,  which i didn\\'t exposedshe is the only reason that this is upsetting me... i have 0 regrets on him,  but on her... i never wanted her to be sad at me because of this...  never was my intention... this is my first post here... just wanted to share my story,  if theres something you guys missunderstood due to my average english,  please comment below,  i really wanted to get this out of me...  if readed till the end... thanks :) ', tags=[125]),\n",

iow i can\\'t even make a lateral move. at this point, i can\\'t go up, i cant go sideways, and the only way to go is down (which is possible because sometimes budget cuts have cut positions like mine - though uncommon, still a real possibility). otherwise i could retire out of the position, but by then, the amount of retirement won\\'t really be significant nor enough to live off.i feel trapped.this is going to sound horrible, but my spouse has become an anchor that\\'s dragging me down. they have health issues, and my job\\'s benefits cover those. but they also have a number of other problems. i don\\'t want to blame my problems on someone else but here\\'s the problem: i\\'ve come to the conclusion that people only change if they want to change. my spouse needs to change. but i can\\'t make them do that. i can\\'t ask or suggest it. if i do i\\'m met with resistance. my only option is to get away from them, or put up with their shit - which i\\'ve been doing for 20+ years. but here\\'s the thing - we have children now and one exhibits most of the same behaviors my spouse does - and i\\'ve come to realize over the years that my spouse had a parent who also exhibited the same issues. now though, our child is amplifying these issues - to the point where i see it as my spouse\\'s fault that my child is this way. my spouse hasn\\'t been diagnosed, but i\\'d say they are a hoarder. so is the child. my spouse refuses to listen to reason, or advice, or will not take any suggestions or recommendations - essentially is stubborn. so is the child. i could go on and on but the basic deal is that i could put up with it to some degree with the spouse, but now that the child is doing it too, it\\'s too much to bear.it may be my fault for being an \"enabler\" and letting them walk all over me - maybe i\\'m too weak, i don\\'t know, but i don\\'t feel it\\'s right to force someone else to do something. but i also have given up on trying to convince them of the right thing to do.it doesn\\'t help that my spouse has become less and less interested in physical love over the years.i think you have to have grounds for a divorce. i don\\'t want to get a divorce - i don\\'t want to be that person - i want it to work out - and it makes me feel like i\\'m giving up, and running away, which is not what i\\'m supposed to do. but again, i\\'m not strong enough to face this issue.my spouse\\'s issues have also put us in a financial mess. we\\'re barely making it. so i couldn\\'t\\' get a divorce if i wanted one, because i can\\'t afford a lawyer.and it seems like everything is like that - i can\\'t make more money without spending money i don\\'t have to get a higher degree - which doesn\\'t even guarantee a job. i can\\'t get a divorce without spending money i don\\'t have to do so. i can\\'t afford a therapist because it\\'s going to cost me money.iow, everything is a significant investment with no promise of any return on that investment - i\\'ll only wind up deeper in the hole.i\\'m not suicidal, and i don\\'t want to make light of depression, but i am at the point where really, there\\'s nothing to look forward to anymore. sure, seeing the kids graduate, having grandkids would be cool, and so on. but it\\'s like, the only way i\\'ll ever get the house clean is if my spouse passes away and i can finally get rid of all of their trash. but what little income they do make will be gone (no life insurance) so the house we\\'ve fought so hard to keep will also be gone (becuase we had to refinance and now we\\'ll be paying until we\\'re 90, or dead). if i go, well, i guess it won\\'t be my problem anymore.so i\\'m trapped again.getting out of the marriage - well, even if i could, there\\'d be child support that i couldn\\'t afford.so it\\'s either stay here and put up with and accept the blistering mediocrity that is my life, while things just continue to deteriorate and deteriorate, or just go away. which is not really something i\\'m considering, so really, i\\'m trapped in a life of mediocrity in a downward spiral. my spouse won\\'t change. my child will probably become even worse with age. i\\'m just going to get more and more distant.i\\'ve considered having an affair - but you know what - i\\'m not the type of person others are attracted to - i don\\'t have any money so the shallow people aren\\'t attracted to me, and i\\'d have to pay for a service like an affair site - which i know most aren\\'t really legit and even the somewhat legit ones aren\\'t going to have people who are attracted to me becuase i\\'m the person they married, not the person they want to have a fling with. plus, it costs money i don\\'t have.but you know, i\\'m not really interested in having an affair. at best it would just be something different to do. and i don\\'t want to treat someone else like that. and i don\\'t want to do that to my spouse. the only thing would be, it would at least be grounds for a divorce.i mean, it\\'s almost - almost mind you - and this would make a good movie plot maybe - it\\'s almost like my spouse has engineered this entire scenario of getting me into a job and family situation where they keep me poor enough to not be able to get out, but just stable enough where they can lay in bed all day and read books, while not helping around the house or with the kids in any meaningful way, on the premise that while they might not be contributing to the finances this month, or for 6 months, in one month they may make a significant enough amount of money to bring us up to just barely behind and keep me trapped in this position.kind of like how america treats the majority of its citizens, but i digress. but yeah, the current national climate doesn\\'t help with hope really.my job does offer 4 free sessions with a therapist. but i see that turning into a money making scam for them ultimately - get you hooked and then...and i can hear the advice now - that\\'s not going to help.basically, my spouse needs to change and if they don\\'t i need to get out. i know they\\'re not going to change. i don\\'t think it\\'s right to give someone ultimatums - i think they need to come to the decision on their own. but it\\'s pretty clear that\\'s not going to happen. and at this point, i\\'ve done enough by myself without any support from my spouse i\\'m don\\'t have the energy or strength to try to help them change, becuase they\\'re not going to accept that there\\'s even anything wrong with what they\\'re doing. i believe it would take me leaving and being gone for them to finally realize it (which, because they have issues with depression, might set me up for guilt for the rest of my life...).', tags=[212]),\n",

spent 3 years learning to forget. the day it became too much for me to hold in is when everything changed. i was sitting down taking it all in when i just broke. my shield that was keeping them from hurting me...shattered into a million pieces along with my heart, my mind, my soul, my life. i ran to the bathroom and cried for what seemed like forever. i went back to class acting as if i was fine and that nothing happened. everyday it just got worse. then summer came, and i was able to start feeling normal. no more people to worry about, i didn't dread leaving my house. 6th grade came around, and i met the most amazing people that i will remember for the rest of my life. 6th grade was a good year, my grades were good, i had great friends...but there was still something that was off. around the end of the year i started getting these awful thoughts. regret filled my life. there were so many things that i wished i could redo and i still do. everyday of my life i think about it and think of how stupid i was. iwas so careless and didn’t realize that what i had done could ruin my life. now what i did exactly won’t be shared...if anyone ever found out i wouldn’t be able to live with myself. i can barely do that now and i’m the only one who knows. summer came around again, and the thoughts got worse. they aren't just bad thoughts about being sad and depressed...i started getting suicidal thoughts...hundreds of them everyday. i dreaded going back to school. i had people in my class that bullied me in 5th grade. i didn’t want to go through that again. so...one night i had an idea. i was at a very low point and was contemplating suicide. i ended up chickening out...but some days i wonder if it would have actually worked. part of me wishes i went through with it, the other half is glad i didn’t. school came around, i was performing well, and the kids didn’t even say anything at all. my friends and i became even more close.my teachers were amazing. 7th grade, i have to say was the happiest point of my life i had ever been in for an extreme amount of time. when it came to an end however so did that happiness. suicide crossed my mind even more, i started self harming in ways that no one would notice. i would do the stereotypical thing and just blame the cat. 8th grade came. my grades dropped. i couldn’t find the energy to do anything. i was constantly tired and i still am. my dreams faded, my hopes for a better life went away because i know that would never happen. i got this app, kik. i should've known to delete the minute i got it. part of my past revolves around this dumb app. actually it’s what started everything. and it’s all. my. fault. i hate myself for it. i worry about so many people i’ve met on the app. i love them all, they're great people and i’ve stopped caring for myself ever since then. i just wish everything would go away. there is honestly so much more to this story, but if i were to tell it all it would take me a million years. now...we’ve hit the present. i’ve stopped eating three meals a day. some days i barely get it one. but that’s ok...i like the feeling of hunger. i like the pain of the blade when it passesover my arm. i like being alone, the less people who know me, the less i can hurt them. the more fake smiles i put on, the more people leave me alone, and believe i’m fine. i’m suicidal but no one knows. i can’t tell anyone...i won’t tell anyone.at least personally. this, what i’m doing anonymously is fine. i can tell my story without feeling too judged. even if i was...it would be nothing compared to how i judge and hate myself. and now you’ve made it to the end...sorry it was so long. there’s so much more to it than that...that's just the basic stuff behind my real emotions...the emotions that are fading. the emotions that i will soon lose, in fact i’m pretty sure i already have. \", tags=[241]),\n",

       " TaggedDocument(words='thanks for taking the time to read this.i\\'ve only now understood the fact that i\\'ve socially isolated myself over the last 5 years.  growing up i played premier soccer on one of the best teams in my state, but quit when i was 15 after making the academy team, a decision i\\'ve come to regret. i remained athletic and played for less competitive teams afterward just to have fun with friends and help them improve their play.  by senior year in highschool, i had dropped all athletics and after school clubs.  i didn\\'t have my drivers license or a car, so i mostly stayed at home at night.  during school i ignore my long time friends with the excuse of getting ahead on homework, but when i got home all i would do is play video games, watch random documentaries on youtube, research random shit, try to write stories, and a bunch of other random things that never amounted to anything.i graduated with no friends.after highschool i went to college and immediately connected with my roommates.  i became really good friends with one of them that i later seperated from because he did not like partaking in smoking weed, even though he was accepting of it, i distanced myself because i didn\\'t want to involve him in it.  but this indirectly lost me my best friend in college.  i never went out to parties that the frats through, i\\'d always give some bs excuse not to go, partly because i was scared of getting an underage drinking infraction and losing my license, partly because i didn\\'t want to socialize.  despite me turning down every party request, i\\'d still smoke with my friends in small groups, but large parties just made me so anxious.  as time went on, i slowly started seperating from those friends though as well because i kept turning down their invites, not just to parties but to do anything.  it became a repeat of highschool, but it started in my second year rather than my senior year.i dropped out of college.college wasn\\'t making me happy, my intended major was biochem (which really interests me even to this day), but the loads of work, lack of friends, and helplessness got me.  i would spend most of my nights crying myself to sleep locked in my dorm room feeling helpless and had nobody to consult.  my grades started slipping once my depressive episodes started lasting whole days at a time where i wouldn\\'t even leave my room to shower or eat, i just kept myself busy playing video games or staring at my wall.  at this point in time i started smoking again to try to help bring myself out of it, but it became too much of a crutch.  i was smoking a little over a quarter ounce every 3-4 days (about 80 usd, 7-10 blunts worth for those who don\\'t smoke).this is why i dropped out of college, because i didn\\'t want to waste the money until i fixed myself.this is when my social isolation started.  i had no remaining friends from highschool i kept in touch with, and lost all of my college friends because i would just ignore their messages and say \"sorry man i got ur message too late\" or \"sorry man i\\'m busy tonight with (insert bullshit excuse)\".  luckily i\\'ve gotten my depression under somewhat better control, although there are times where i still can\\'t control them or recenter myself.  but really what it\\'s done is make me feel inadequate.  after months of thinking about it, i think the root of it is that i have nothing fulfilling in life.  i think since i quite soccer, i\\'ve never had anything to immerse myself with, i can\\'t find that thing to get me up in the mornings.  i literally snooze my alarm for 1-2 hours a day because i hate waking up...i guess what i\\'m really asking is how do i find fulfillment in a life where i feel inadequate at everything i do.  coupled with that, i\\'ve seem to become very socially anxious.some other stuff to include to give you guys a full picture, i work as a cashier.  almost every one of customers loves me because i have such a cheery attitude (i think the reason i\\'m ok with this is because the conversations i have are familiar, almost routine).  i am the kind of guy to give you the shirt off my back if it\\'ll help u, but wont take a handout if i\\'m starving.i have plans to hike the appalachian trail (full thru-hike) once i pay off my remaining student debt because i thought that it would help me more than anything to just bring my life back to the basics, food and shelter.  the only activity i do is hiking really, even that i do alone and now that it\\'s winter it\\'s much more uncomfortable.any advice is welcome.  thank you~', tags=[270]),\n",

yet i still can\\'t bring myself to accept that because i have some sense of self, and that even if my self is miserable i don\\'t want not be me.i honestly don\\'t know what i want to do with this. am i typing it for catharsis? do i want to post it somewhere or give it to someone? do i want it left behind for someone to read when i\\'m dead? maybe all of the above.i think the fact that i haven\\'t killed myself yet is another part of my weakness. that i\\'m afraid to die despite hating life so much. and i hate the people who say that continuing to live despite hating myself is brave. its not. i continue to live because i can\\'t kill myself. there\\'s nothing brave about not having a choice.i feel like its a vicious cycle. does my hatred for myself make me a hypocrite? because i hate every trait about myself that i see in other people. if i see any of myself in others then i start to hold disdain for them. even my dad from whom my traits might derive. i can\\'t stand these things about my self in anyone.i\\'ve been trying to find out recently to find out why i\\'m so fucked in the head. trauma seems like a good scapegoat. i have trust issues. i have attatchment issues when i do trust someone. i\\'m clingy. i\\'m jealous, insanely jealous. i\\'m extremely selfish too, like i said earlier. i want someone to call mine and that more importantly that i can say i\\'m theres. somewhere i belong.i think i only can exist at streams. like i don\\'t  have a filter. i\\'m too nice or i\\'m too mean. maybe it\\'s why i can\\'t find someone special. i hear being too nice drives people away from relationships so i try to mix it in with being a bit of an ass at times... but when i do i go too far or i do it too much.i think about getting a gun sometimes. i\\'d have to go to a gunshow or get a license though. i just want something that if i ever felt strong enough despair i could pull the trigger and end my life. something there and at the ready in the event i can finally kill myself.i live in fantasy. somewhere i can pretend to be someone else. someone happier. someone who\\'s loved or important. i don\\'t think people fully understand that because it sounds like i already have it. i want to be loved and important beyond just being a human. i don\\'t think just existing deserves those things, like people assume that i am. \"there are people who love you.\" there\\'s a person who loves me, because i am his child. i didn\\'t earn that love, they don\\'t love me for who i am. they love me because i am. nothing else. if i had no relation to him he wouldn\\'t even acknowledge me.i\\'m tired of writing, and rereading this to proof read it i really don\\'t care to. i\\'m just going to look for somewhere to post it for attention. for someone\\'s acknowledgement. i told you i\\'m selfish. i sort of hope that someone takes a different view of depression from this too though. that someone realizes that depressed people aren’t all saints to be helped or coddled, just because they haven’t done anything bad doesn’t mean those thoughts don’t exist. it doesn’t mean that i’m not a very twisted person.because i do not know how it reddit will perceive my given thoughts on medication, i’ll add that these are my own thoughts and warped morals. if it wasn’t clear i’m screwed in the head and no one should be taking advice from me on the ethics of medication.', tags=[385]),\n",

       " TaggedDocument(words='hi, this is my first post on this subreddit. this was originally a bit of a rant due to unwanted attention during a black dog moment, and i have decided to leave it in it\\'s raw form as opposed to proof reading it as an article. i hope you find it interesting.being in a hole is never a nice place to be, being overwhelmed or panicky, it\\'s horrible, and can be triggered quite randomly it seems, but there is one thing that i find is really difficult to explain, maybe it\\'s different for boys than it is for girls, but it\\'s being in a hole and needing to find your own way out. my experience is that i want to find my own way out... on my own... once i can see a way out that\\'s when i want help, when i can see the reachable foot and hand holds, but don\\'t have the strength to use them to pull be up. that initial alone time can become essential when shame is the overall black dog component. sometimes something may happen that brings about a lot of personal shame. when this happens, really the last thing you want is people asking you about it, asking if you\\'re ok, wanting to know about it. why?? to me a true friend is some one you love and admire and is there for you when you reach out to them and i am lucky, i have a handful of very good friends, they are always pleased to see me, we always have lots to talk about because there are no expectations. one of the things i really love about these friends is that they won\\'t probe even if i look a little down. they will make cups of tea when i go round, they will talk about the latest interesting things and they won\\'t go anywhere near that black dog even if it\\'s sat on my lap chewing at one of my forearms, unless of course i ask them to help me get it off my lap. then they will listen and do um\\'s and ah\\'s in all the right places, maybe give an experience they have had to make me not feel so alone. but one thing they never do is start throwing a stick for the dog while it\\'s sat on my lap. to me this is true friendship and a real special part of humanity it\\'s incredibly empathetic and caring.now then there are the other types, the ones who probe when you are not ok, they think they are helping by wanting to share your pain and understand it. so let\\'s just have a little look at what is going on during these difficult times: resources are low, you might be a winter sufferer, money maybe a worry, that\\'s fairly common these days, but whatever it is that triggers dark times, the big overall blanket of what might possibly be going on is \"shame\", personal shame. shame comes in many forms, but i am guessing for a lot of people it boils down to one thing: \"i am having difficulty coping and i am ashamed that i can\\'t seem to stand on my own two feet.\"so going back to people trying to help... if you are in a dark spot and you are ashamed or embarrassed about things, these times do pass, they really do, for some it may be only a couple of hours, for some it maybe days or weeks, but they do pass. during these times, it is indeed difficult to reach out, to admit you are not coping is the ultimate in exposure, so for some people just hiding away for a short while can be very resource building. so you then have someone poke the dog awake for you and ask you to go through that shame all over again is really very difficult to deal with. not only are you down and despondent with your own embarrassment, but now you have someone poking that into life appearing on the surface to be doing a great deed, while under the surface, what is happening is that the dog is starting to grumble and growl as the depression is now being compounded with social pressure and the shame that you were not able to please the people pleaser and help them feel better by suddenly being ok.yes, unfortunately, many people want to help at the slightest thing for whatever reason, be it low self esteem, or they are trying to drag themselves out of a hole they can\\'t see. but really... don\\'t do it. most people suffering from depression know exactly what is going on for them, they\\'ve lived with it all their lives and know that actually, being alone is where they need to be for an hour or so. the bliss of being able to be around someone without having to speak to them is for me a huge compliment and everyone has their safe people that they can do this with. other people need to get out of the way and go and live there own lives for those few hours. i do that, i see when people are in a hole and after about 2 of 3 sentences it becomes quite obvious where you should be whether being there making tea and sitting next to them reading a book or walking away to another place to let the sufferer find their own resources.what i think i am saying here, is if you are not chosen as someones good friend, it\\'s not personal, everybody likes different people, but please don\\'t then pass your own low self esteem and shame onto someone who is depressed because you are not in their chosen circle.', tags=[446]),\n",

15, freshman year, i remember i was trying to drown myself in an ex friends pool. i just wanted to drown there, i think it was because i didn\\'t want to go home or something, but i remember she was trying to help me not drown. don\\'t know why, i thought i was being a horrible person. why help me? anyway skip ahead to a certain year, don\\'t remember at this point. i stopped caring at the time i guess. i was in class, i remember we had to do an assignment on something, don\\'t remember what assignment it was but i know it was on the computer. i wrote something very depressing on it. didn\\'t know teachers could see what we typed down. my teacher had me leave the classroom and follow her to the school counselor. at that point i knew what i as there for. my teacher mrs. d i\\'ll call her for now showed me what i typed in front of the counselor. she asked if everything was okay, i lied and told her that was a part of an assignment. i guess maybe it wasn\\'t for an actual assignment and that i was just typing whatever came to mind.i was sent back to class, and mrs. d asked if everything was actually okay, i told her everything is fine. skip ahead to last year of high school, went to this senior day thing at the end of our high school year, i remember i was really down, i didn\\'t want to go to this thing and just wanted to stay home to do nothing. i didn\\'t eat and didn\\'t want to. i was having a food withdrawal headache. we went to this hypnotist and i still felt like going home. i remember being chosen to be hypnotised, i was like sure, whatever hypnotise me. let the dude do whatever, apparently i was only chosen because i was the shortest to sit underneath the speaker. i just look up and shrug. didn\\'t care, everyone laughed like i was joking.skip ahead, was feeling like shit for the first year not going to college. i wanted to go when my ex went, he was a year behind me, so he was still in high school. i wanted to wait till he got out of high school so then me and him could go to college together. but then found out his mom wanted him to go to a four hour drive to a different college i was going to. he ended up with the cougar\\'s, and i stayed back at lpc, saying those initials for identity reasons. i just thought wow okay changed our plans. that\\'s nice to know. i hate when plans change. so when he was off for seemed like forever, i would miss him a ton.we had our break up and i\\'m cool with it cause i don\\'t think i\\'m emotionally stable to be in a relationship at all. i remember i was living in the heart of town, my mom had always yelled at me and my siblings. for something so little. \"wash dishes!\" \"vacuum!\" this was back when i wasn\\'t in college anymore, being a poor sport being cruddy and shit like that. i would be the only one to wash the dishes and vacuum because my siblings were lazy. one day like everyday i wasn\\'t in a very good mood. i was in so much pain and felt trapped and wanted to die and get over this thing called life. my mom yelled at me to come wash the dishes. er i think it was she wanted the dishes done before she got home. i forgot to wash them, i was so deep in depression i forgot about the dishes. my mom got home, saw the dishes were still not clean, she yells at me, i tell her i forgot, she tells me \"you forgot. like always you forget the things i\\'ve told you do to.\" i looked down at the table i sat to, about to draw. she continues on \"i guess i\\'m a horrible mother. maybe i should go and kill myself huh!?\" or something like that because i was already in tears and hurting that i didn\\'t care.i get up from the table, i quietly go to my sisters room while my dead beat uncle distracts her, i look through my clothes to find warm ones and put them on, my uncle comes in tells me whatever and tells me to not make any bad choices. i ignored him, got dressed, grabbed my phone and headphones and left. i walked to the bridge, sat on the railing of the bridge and looked down at the water. wondering if it even was far enough to kill me. i would occasionally look at the corner of my eyes to see cars drive by. a few slowed down, i was too depressed to care what anyone thought at this point. one car stopped, which i saw at the corner of my eye, i looked at them, i shrugged and turned back to the water. then sometime after, it felt really short, the cops got there, i told them to stay back and tightened my grip of the railing. they persuaded me and i got down, they hand cuffed me, put me in the ambulance, and this male nurse talked to me the whole way to the hospital, afterwards they put me in this room. it was white, had a bed, thin white blankets, no pillow. corners of the bed was round, not sharp.what felt like hours finally some guy came in to draw blood from me, he sat next to me, he looked like he was scared of me. i didn\\'t care, i sat there letting him draw blood from me. the pain from that needle was the only thing i felt that day. my mom was the one who picked me up from the hospital, i felt bad. i don\\'t know why, but i did. it\\'s not like she cared anyway. or at least that\\'s how it felt to me. fast forward we lived up on this slanted driveway. i remember i was having that kind of day, where i just wanted my life to end. i was talking to my ex boyfriend, he was also having a shitty day i guess. i wanted to see him. i remember he couldn\\'t see me and we couldn\\'t be together because i hurt him and he was already dating someone. i felt so bad remembering breaking up with him. i\\'m not going to say what i did because i still feel pretty bad about it even though it was 5 years ago. i was feeling bad for it that i just started hitting my forehead against the metal bar on the bunk bed.then i went to the closet, grabbed a plastic bag and tried suffocating myself, i couldn\\'t do it. i couldn\\'t kill myself. i need someone else to kill me. i remember i told my mom i was about to kill myself. i told her how. she looked at me with concern. i shrugged, she hugged me, i didn\\'t hug back because i don\\'t like hugging. i didn\\'t like people touching me. at this point i didn\\'t care that she was hugging me. skip ahead, i remember i was on this app, i was chatting and trying to be happy, suddenly i felt like shit for no reason. like a wave of negative shit blanketed me. i walked outside looking over the porches rail, then looking out to the road, thinking \"run me over. just ram me with your car.\" i would even look at the dog and say aloud \"kill me. bite me. tear me to shreds.\" but no matter, i looked out to the road again, sighing out depressingly. i just wanted my life to end.skip ahead, i started living with my grandma, i remember i was so depressed that when my grandma pushed me to talk, cause i was holding back tears, you know that feeing you get when you try to speak but your throat feels swollen and you can\\'t so when you finally try even harder to say something, you end up yelling at them instead? well, that happened to me. she yelled at me back \"don\\'t yell at me!\" i felt bad and stupid and just wanted to jump out the window. we were in the car. skip ahead, i was in the bedroom, grandma was yelling something to me, don\\'t remember what it was, but i ended up yelling at her and curling up in a ball, i thought curling up in a ball would calm me down and make me quiet. i just wanted to disappear. at that point i knew i had anxiety. i was rapidly breathing, my heart was racing and it felt like i wasn\\'t getting enough air. i was shaking and tears were rolling down my cheeks.skip ahead, i started living with my dad. my grandma kicked me out. i had no where else to go, since i was angry at my mom i didn\\'t want to live with her again. so i struggled there as well. i had my anxiety levels go through the roof there, rent and shit couldn\\'t be paid fast enough, i was nagged to get a job there. i tried so hard, i didn\\'t have a vehicle, or license. i had to walk all the way into town, this was an entirely different town. i was forced to go out and look for a job. on foot. almost everyday. my feet had blisters. my knees were weak. i stressed so badly living there, i still wanted to die. skip ahead, i was forced to live with my mom again, she hasn\\'t changed. she still blames me, yells at me and fakes her love on me. i got a job, been working for 2 and a half months. my second paycheck i get i was going to save for christmas gifts. i told my mom this 3 times. she yells at me about the money.i felt like ever since i get paid, people are always asking me for money. i\\'m sick of money. i hate it. i hate that a lot of shit is too expensive. i went into the bathroom because i didn\\'t want to be seen crying. i hate crying, i try not to cry when i\\'m about to every time. my mom hears me whimper a little, then suddenly says \"are you crying? babies cry! what are you a baby!? waah waah baby!\" i just kept silent. i hated conflict. that\\'s why i didn\\'t speak, that\\'s why i hid in the bathroom, that\\'s why i try not to cry. apparently i\\'m a sensitive person, is what she called me. i guess maybe that is what i am. skip ahead i was taking a very nice hot shower, you know enjoying my me time. my mom bursts in and yells \"are you paying for the water bill!? do you just want to take that whole bill and pay it yourself!?\" i silently turn the water off, after i get clothes on i walk out, she goes \"thanks for making the water bill go high.\"i walk out of the room and walk to the couch i have to sleep on because i don\\'t have a bedroom or a bed. my dead beat uncle walks in and off goes my moms mouth on the couch next to me \"yeah i have bills to pay, the water bill is probably higher now then it was.\" like i wasn\\'t right fucking there! i held back my tears as much as i could, wrote a rant somewhere in a subreddit. skip ahead, i wanted to try the roast chicken flavored cup of noodles, i haven\\'t had any yet, after i sit on the couch and start eating my brother walks behind me (which i hate) and asks \"is it spicy?\" i told him no, he says \"the chicken one?\" i told him the roast chicken flavor, then my mom out of no where \"don\\'t eat all of the food! that has to last us all week!\" i told her that this cup was my first one, she goes on \"go ahead eat all the food that\\'s supposed to last us a week in one day!\" i lost my appetite. i set the cup of noodles on the table, and just contemplated my death. i\\'m going to kill myself before i turn 30, i\\'m 26

       " TaggedDocument(words='i don’t really know where to begin. i don’t really know whether i have depression. maybe i don’t have any mental health issues at all. maybe i’m just a privileged, lazy ass motherfucker making excuses for himself. i feel as if my problems don’t seem acute or real enough for me to gain any sort of understanding or sympathy from anyone. my parents are upper middle class, white-collar professionals in hong kong. i’m a high school senior at a boarding school in the u.s. that costs $58k a year. there’s been roughly half a dozen attempted suicides and one successful one in the last three years at my school. it feels like a prison. part of me feels guilty for complaining about the way i feel because i’m not starving or homeless or being shot at, which contributes to my depression. i’m an alcoholic. i drink almost every week — whatever i can get my hands on. i showed up hungover to an interview at oxford a few weeks back. it’s a long story. basically, i applied to their philosophy, politics, and economics (ppe) program. i never thought i would make the interview shortlist, but i did. when i landed at heathrow i became really depressed for absolutely no reason, so i got plastered at an airport hotel. they didn’t card me, which was the only awesome thing that happened to me in the past month.i hear back from oxford on jan 10th, but my parents and relatives won’t shut up about it. my asian dad exploded when i told him i wasn’t applying to harvard or yale. my entire school knows about my application to oxford as well, because i missed a whole week of classes during the interview process. two weeks ago i showed up to a school exam without a tie (boarding school has really uptight dress codes), and my teacher yelled, “quit acting like a moron...applying to oxford when you don’t know how to put a tie on...\" i got these blinding flashes of anger. so i sabotaged my exam. answered a c for every multiple-choice question. my teacher ran out of the classroom after me, and i threatened to kill myself. after spending three hours with a counselor, i went back to my room and chugged two cans of some crappy margarita. i don’t think anyone else really understands the pressure that i’m under, the shame that i’ll feel when i open the thin envelope. it’s not that i really want to attend oxford — it’s that i’m really fucking scared about what everyone else will think of me when i get rejected. for the past couple years i’ve been looking at salaries on glassdoor. it’s an unhealthy addiction. i obsess over whether i would earn more as a future associate or partner at wlrk or cravath or whatnot. or whether i should go into banking or management consulting or whatnot. i’ve always been impressed by the reports that i read on the websites of goldman sachs, mckinsey & co, the harvard business review — but reading them makes me feel like i don’t know shit about the planet i live on — about our economy and our society. like i’m utterly unqualified to do anything significant and meaningful on this planet. i\\'ve been reading newspapers and magazines (mainly nyt, the economist, foreign affairs) since i was in 3rd grade, and i can\\'t help but think that this world is a crappy place. i guess what i’m trying to say is that i worry a lot. some of it has to do with political and economic trends — trade and globalization, automation and ai, whether the rise in right-wing populism will negatively affect political decision-making in western democracies. i hate being a powerless teenager. wish i could change that. but another reason why i have this career anxiety is for selfish reasons. money. part of me feels as if i\\'m not going to get laid without a 7-figure investment portfolio and a corner office because i\\'m a loser. i look like a loser. or maybe it\\'s the fact that all the other kids around me seem so much wealthier, and i want to outdo them. my parents are pretty parsimonious with my allowance, whereas half the kids at my school have their wardrobes stuffed full of gucci/lv/burberry. i live in constant fear that i\\'ll be 40 and a virgin and stuck in a fucking cubicle drinking crappy whiskey because i won\\'t be able to afford macallan on $30k a year. and then i\\'ll go on instagram and see brad (not a real person at my school) at his summer home, in a porsche downing dom perignon with his blonde trophy wife. my depression is affecting my high school grades. that’s why i’m not applying to harvard or yale. because i have a 3.4 gpa — like, it’s a guaranteed rejection. i had great grades my first couple years, but things took a turn for the worse junior year. now i’m barely passing my classes. sometimes i’m too drunk to work. sometimes i just sit on my bed and wallow in my despair. i just got an email today saying that i’ve failed my first semester of english, because i haven’t turned in half my essays. i’m not going to graduate if my grades don’t pick up the second half of senior year. it’s not the first time i failed something. i used to really enjoy math. i used to be pretty good at math — i took the ap calculus bc exam when i was 13 years old and scored a 5. last year i took an online course on differential equations and number theory, and i failed. i hate math now. it just doesn’t excite me the way it used to. i know it\\'s ironic that i\\'m so ambitious and my career is already in tatters. my teachers won’t stop yelling at me. they don’t think i’m depressed. they say i’m just a lazy ass motherfucker who could easily get straight as. my college counselor made a snide joke about me being the only high school dropout in the country with a 36 act. maybe they’re right. maybe i’m not depressed. maybe they’re right. but i feel depressed. i feel as if i’ve been punched in the gut everyday. i constantly feel deflated, disappointed. i can’t get out of bed in the morning without half an hour of crying. no one understands me. they feel as if i should be happy because i’m fortunate enough to attend such a “great school”, telling me to “get over it”. i don’t know what i’m gonna do. especially when i get rejected from oxford, or when i fail to graduate. maybe i’m going to hang myself with a tie. the most colorful way of suicide that i’ve devised is to get an uber to the closest city and snort enough coke off a russian hooker’s ass to

       " TaggedDocument(words='hi, everyone.first post here with this account, but long time lurker.being my first post, it will be quite long and introduttive, so if you don’t feel like reading it i’m completely fine with it.it all started with my first suicide attempt:being a creative person with a gift for drawing since when i was born, after graduating from an art high school with good grades, i chose the only school in my country that offered animation courses. my passion was such that i took the courage to leave home to another far away city in the south (had a lot of pressure and expectations from everyone, including me), and being a very insecure guy (half japanese who was bullied through mid school) it was a big leap for me.-first year of college went pretty well, made many new friends, started living and making choices independently (being an only child i never had to compete with others for attention), and albeit my parents were still paying for me, i felt a bit guilty but at the same time happy because it seemed worth it (artistically and emotionally too).-post school summer was kind of fine for me with a part-time job, only problem i had was a sudden heavy loss of hair, which made me super anxious and obsessive for 2 months (having no one to talk to because friends and  parents were abroad made me less stable).-second year of school starts, i find myself sharing a room with a classmate in the suburbs, suddenly moving out, coupled with lots of anxieties made by a different environment, never ending traffic sounds (i’ve lived all my life in the very quiet venice,  the only city in the world with no cars) and stress from school made the first 3 months very difficult, but i tried my hardest and went on.the animation program forced me to stay many hours a day staring closely at a pc monitor, which caused me continuous headaches and loss of vision, but i still felt i could resist a bit until christmas holidays.problem is, my habits started to become worse everyday, from not eating, heavy insomnia and panic attacks, to difficulty in respiration, anxiety, semi-complete lack of communication with everyone, and finally self harm (stabbed my hands with a compass many times, hit my head on the wall until i bled).it’s at that moment that i found reddit and this sub (i even spent time lurking in r/watchpeopledie).all of this in complete secrecy from everyone, because i didn’t want to worry them.the day before my roommates returned to the apartment, out of shame and fear, i roamed in an immense park all day, under freezing temperatures, wearing only light clothes.it eventually led me to almost lose consciousness out of hypothermia, and the moment i found myself before a very high waterfall, i suddenly felt the urge to finish it all.the only reason i’m still here is because after i slipped near the edge and almost fell in the icy water, my survival instincts surfaced and made me grapple onto some bushes, thus saving myself from death.it wasn’t a logical backing off, it’s just that i felt i didn’t want to die in that way after having felt that cold in the water (i remember it was like having hundreds of needles into your body).needless to say, after i crawled my way home, my parents got informed and i failed out of college.in a few days it’s gonna be an year since i attempted.what did i lose?-basically almost all of my already scarce relationships-every passion and pleasure in any activity i can think of (music and drawing give me no emotions)-every sexual/romantic desire (during mid school i had to go through a very painful rehabilitation two times after a first failed  surgery to my penis which had a curvature that made sex impossible)what did i gain? _anhedonia_having sex for the first time with a prostitute in japan out of desperation didn’t feel that physically pleasurable (two penis surgeries made me less sensitive)my parents recent divorce would’ve destroyed me emotionally if i still had the ability to feel emotions. i couldn’t feel emotions to such a level they asked me if i was human anymore, since i showed zero reactions to it.seeing friends and relatives after 1 year of isolation, exercise, food, meditation, music, drawing and  everything i used to like, they all feel meaningless to me.my current therapy sessions are not helping much either.anhedonia influences everything in my life,  receiving calls, messages, visits and gifts from the people i care about gives me zero emotion, the same applies if i don’t answer them for days or months.no guilt, crying or emotion at all, nor any incentives to call them back.it all feels like a dream, or nightmare, but from which i can’t wake up (i can’t count how many times i passed in front of speeding cars without caring, or how bleak and meaningless current society is to me).i’d want to say everything feels the same, but the word “_feels_” doesn’t mean anything to me anymore.i can’t find again the empathy towards others and myself, so i don’t even recognize myself in me, it’s like i’m living someone’s else existence.is life without emotions worth living?edit: to whoever took their time to read all of this, thank you so much!!!even if you don’t feel to leave a comment, just the fact that someone read this means i wasn’t rambling in vain.', tags=[642]),\n",

i decided to try and plead to my employer and explain the anxiety. she looked at me as if i was speaking a foreign language. i think i have cried everyday since i had that fateful conversation with my boss. i can still recall her advice to “not let my personal drama get in the way of my success.” and then she gave me a box to collect my belongings.it’s been almost a month since i quit my job and i feel lost. i feel like i have no purpose and nothing to add to the great capitalism of america. the only thing keeping me here is my devoted fiancé and his mother who has been like a mother to me from the moment we met. they are trying to build me up, but i feel like a failure again. i do not feel like i can keep going on in a world of cold and unfeeling extroverts and narcissists. i do not have the money to see a counselor or life coach. i feel like my only option is stop the pain, but i love my fiancé so desperately. i want a job with a deeper meaning and purpose—something that impacts others and touches their hearts. it is hard for me to imagine going on like this anymore.

       " TaggedDocument(words=\"just trying to work out why i feel so depressed, when this year was one of the happiest i've had for ages.before 2017, i had been depressed for years, without any kind of direction in life. the only times i felt happy was when i was with my best friend. whenever i was with her, i felt like i was home. she inspired me to be a better person and i wanted to be seen as good in her eyes. we had so many laughs together and shared a really deep bond. but she was the only person who made me feel that way. nothing and no one else did. and i guess i didn't realise she had her own depression to deal with. she withdrew more and more from me until we hardly saw each other at all. she'd often disappear from my life for weeks or she'd cancel plans and make excuses, only to return in random bursts like nothing had happened. i felt like i put in ten times as much effort as her and it frustrated me. then at one point i confided in a mutual friend about how i felt about her. only she overheard, got really angry and cut me out of her life for good. she was done.this really upset me and i found it hard to deal with. the pain was so bad i ended up going into 'beast mode' and deciding to just change my whole mindset. i told myself i couldn't let depression win. so i used the hurt as a fuel to do better for myself and prove that i am worthy of love and happiness. i had a fire to achieve more than i ever had before. so when 2017 begun i made myself a plan to get my life in shape. i set myself some goals (make new friends, get a new job'hobbies, start dating again etc). i pushed myself to do things i never thought i could do (i'm a very shy person). i got a new job working from home. i started trying out new hobbies. most importantly, i set up a 'meet up group' for locals in my area who were looking to make new friends. it gained a lot more interest than i thought and suddenly i had a booming social life. it felt really good and i was proud of myself, but i still felt a little lonely inside, like no one really connected with me. then one day this guy joined my group. there was something really cool and different about him. we got to talking and we bonded rather quickly. then we started to meet up regularly and go for drinks together. it wasn't long before he made a pass at me and we started kissing. i didn't even know if i was that interested him, i was just caught up in the moment and flattered by the attention (also, we were drunk). then it started to be a regular thing where we'd go out for drinks together and end up kissing/fooling around. he seemed a bit of a player who was only after one thing, but honestly i didn't feel like i needed to be in a relationship with him. just the fact that someone like him was even remotely interested in me was enough to boost my confidence and make me feel insanely happy. throughout the whole spring and summer of this year, i was buzzing with a new lease of life. i felt free. i was enjoying my job, i loved hanging out with a variety of people in my group, and i just felt excited for the future. i felt in control (that's probably key to it all). i felt in control of my own happiness. i didn't seek out attention, but people naturally seemed to like me and enjoy my company. i wasn't dependant on anyone (or so i thought). besides the guy, i made about 4 or 5 close friends from the meet-ups and we now have our own 'sub group' if you like. they are now a regular part of my life and its really nice.as time went on, me and this guy got closer (not even in a romantic way, we just became really close friends). he was going through a lot of personal stuff and he'd always confide in me and i'd get calls and texts from him all the time. we'd have late night convos and offer each other advice. he even apologised for having 'played me' at the beginning and told me he really appreciated my company. i felt like i had a deep connection with someone again and it felt really nice. i think we spent every single weekend together for about 4 months in a row.but now that the colder months have come, i'm feeling really depressed. i kind of suspected i might feel this way because i tend to get down in winter anyway. i stopped bothering with the 'meet up' group, mainly because not many people are showing interest anymore. i still hang out with the 'sub group' but for some reason, being around them doesn't excite me as much. it's become mundane. now the guy i'm close with has started being a bit distant from me. i don't think its on purpose but he's got a lot of new things going on in his life and he's too focused on them to remember to contact me. i'm now starting to feel anxious for the first time in ages and i feel i don't have control anymore. it's like this guy has replaced my ex-best friend as my source of happiness. no one else makes me feel 'alive' but when i hear from him i instantly feel ten times better. i feel i've developed real feelings for him. the last time i saw him he even mentioned he was interested in dating me properly but somehow i didn't quite believe him because he's been so on/off with me lately. he's just too self-absorbed to become my boyfriend and knowing this makes me sad. i feel like getting into anything serious with him will only intensify my anxiety.i just feel like all of the happiness i felt has now disppeared. back in the summer, i was free and in control. i was making new friends left right and centre, and i had a guy who was really interested in me, but there were no ties or emotional attachments and it was nice. now i'm riddled with anxiety. the friends in my subgroup are expecting commitments from me all the time and i feel like i'm now chasing this guy (instead of the other way round). isn't that sad? i fulfilled all of my goals but the only thing that makes me feel happy and alive is if i'm getting attention from this one person. i don't think i can live like this but it feels like i'm trying everything to become happy in myself. \", tags=[909]),\n",

past to better grasp reality, and better take care of my mind.  i\\'m a 26 year old guy who recently finished a masters degree in chemical engineering, loves to play the drums (marched nearly a decade worth of drumline including two years of drum corps), and even had the privilege to learn how to fly an aircraft with my grandfather.  you would think with that short description alone that there\\'s no way i could reach such a low as wanting to end my life when i have been so fortunate to experience and achieve what i have to this point.  but i have been that low, now four times in my life.---case #1: first ever suicidal thoughts---the first case of me ever thinking to end my life was back in junior year of high school.  i had so much going on back then; my dad was knee deep building our new house, which he expected me to spend any free time i had helping him with the house work (we did most of the grunt work - digging trenches, heavy lifting, whatever we could do to gives contractors zero excuse to meet their deadlines).  every day after school that\\'s how i spent my free time.  meanwhile at school i was taking advanced placement courses to try to get a jump on college, while having the responsibility of drumline captain and playing drums for basically every part of our music department (all stress-relievers... but it was all so time consuming).  i never caught a break during my high school years.  every day was action packed.  not enough hours in the day.  it was draining.  and then my dad pushed me over the edge - he had stresses meeting his own deadlines building the house that he would lose patience with me non-stop.  i had to help him with the house, but i also had my ap chemistry homework to get done.  i was always holding him back because i never understood what he wanted me to do, or i simply would do things wrong (i\\'ve never built a house before!), or wasn\\'t working hard enough.  he always resorted to yelling brutally at me to the point of feeling like utter trash.  and he doesn\\'t mean to be that way - it\\'s just in his nature, and he of course was also highly stressed.  but it got so bad over time that i seriously contemplated ending my life.  i was fortunate to have the sanity then to call my mom out of desperation (my parents divorced when i was about 10 years old), and she immediately came to pick me up and bring me to her house to get my homework done there.  remember this incident because it\\'s going to come full circle later.---case #2: dropping/changing majors in college---fast-forward 5 years.  i\\'m in year 3 of 6 of the pharmacy (pharmd) program at university of rhode island.  i had two d+\\'s already due to final exams from the fall, in classes where i was comfortably sitting at b- grades.  it was a killer... it instantly put me on the edge of failing out of the major.  and then spring final exams came around... final grades were submitted by mid-may... two d+\\'s.  again.  at this point it was inevitable.  i was going to have to drop out of pharmd.  they were willing to let me try to redeem myself in the 4th year but i knew that would be a freaking miracle if it ever happened.  from what i heard, the program only gets harder.  during the tail end of that year, i became suicidal again.  the thoughts were endless.  i felt like such a failure in every regard.  it was like every accomplishment i ever had went straight out the window, because i couldn\\'t get through one of the most difficult college programs that exists.  against my dad\\'s wishes i changed my major to chemical engineering (my second choice if i didn\\'t get accepted to pharmd).  i was always a chemistry whiz, but it was clear that i was in the wrong field in pharmd.  rote memorization, and extreme test-taking were my biggest weaknesses as a student and those two things sadly are what decide whether or not you make it through any medical program.  luckily for me it was the best decision i ever made for myself, as i now stand here holding a masters in che.  but at the time of making that crucial decision, it was extremely taxing.  the thoughts of suicide to me seemed like just as good of an option as my change of major.  i made it through strictly by distracting myself - drumming, seeing my girlfriend at the time, doing things that made me happy while away at school.  but it was only temporary relief from myself.---case #3: masters thesis research struggles---fast forward again to a few years later (dec. 2016 timeframe).  i was working on a che masters degree doing research for the department of homeland security helping further the development of sensors capable of detection of homemade explosives used by terrorists.  this was really involved stuff, and certainly mentally taxing.  but the science and research wasn\\'t what was so taxing.  it was the constant pattern of repetitive failure (necessary in the research world, but nonetheless was eating at me).  i was beginning to disprove previous findings, disprove my own findings, and at one point actually psyched myself out thinking i was the issue with the research and why i couldn\\'t get anything to work.  i backed out of two conferences citing \"inconclusive research\" as my reasoning for not going.  then i started going insane in my sleep.  they were back.  the suicidal thoughts were back and worse than ever.  the internet searches for suicide methods (what\\'s more painless?) were in full force.  there are multiple bridges in my state… “which one is the closest to jump off?  maybe the one that’s further away, but taller, will better guarantee death more quickly… maybe that should be the one i jump from?”  i thought about poisoning myself, jumping off a tall building, jumping into interstate traffic, multiple options.  and i felt these were all real solutions to a problem – i felt like i was a problem which i was solving through what i thought was a logical means: ending my life.  so how did i make it through that mess?  i was saved by two friends of mine the night i was thinking about driving to one of the big suspension bridges in my state (ri).  they showed up to my house seemingly out of nowhere, and wanted to see how i was doing.  i don’t know how they knew… but someone was able to tell something was wrong with me.  word must have spread like wildfire for them to find out and do something about it.  i was a wreck.  i broke down crying talking to them where they reminded me of my other accomplishment; i already held a bachelor’s degree.  i forgot about that completely.  none of that mattered to me in the moment because i couldn’t make progress on my research for the ms degree.  it was encouraging talking to them, but also encouraging me to quit my masters and move on with only a bachelors degree.  two days of pondering that passed, and one of my undergraduate assistants tried out an old sensor we were meaning to experiment with at some point, and observed the first real detection of explosives we have seen in the lab in my time working on the project.  it shed light on multiple reproducibility issues we were having, and we hit the ground running.  fast-forward 8 months later, i defended my thesis successfully.  also during that time i got my first engineering job.  so everything’s great now, right?  school stresses are gone for good, i landed a solid first engineering job… no chance i could fall into the darkness that is suicidal tendencies ever again… right?wrong.---case #4: dad... again---over the last few months i have been seeing a therapist, after recommendations to do so from my closest friends and some family who understand what i have been dealing with.  i have vented to her and told her all of these things i’m sharing here, but in much more excruciating detail.  it has helped me immensely.  i learned so much about myself in the process, and about my family, and about the issues i am facing with depression.  and what timing… another suicidal episode was about to commence.remember the first case, where my dad induced it through yelling at me repeatedly during the house project?  well now it’s about to get much worse.  the incident this time (as dumb as this is going to sound)… i forgot to clean my bathroom upstairs.  my stepmom told me she would like me to get it done that night because she’s having friends over the next day.  and i said “sure, no problem!”  i was in the middle of an online game at the time playing with friends, and i was simply going to finish the match we were already in for about 20 more minutes, then go clean the bathroom.  nope!dad started yelling up the stairs.  he demanded i drop everything and get the bathroom done that instant.  i mean… i was about 5 or 10 minutes from getting it done, what difference does it make whether i did it right then, or waited a few minutes?  didn’t matter.  he demanded i shut my game down, and get the chore done that instant.  so i obliged, and said “okay! okay! i’ll get it done right now!”  so i went back to my room, shut the game down, still heard dad yelling at me, repeating himself as he usually does… and it didn’t stop.  he was still yelling at me over and over.  there came a point where my mind started playing defense; i tuned him out completely… i didn’t hear a word he said.  i went into the bathroom… started setting up the cleaning supplies, and in comes my dad storming in, yelling at me louder than i think he ever has in my life.  he was demanding acknowledgment.  in my head i was thinking, “what?  i acknowledged him already.  i’m cleaning the bathroom.  why is he still yelling at me?”  then i finally heard him clearly again once my mind came back to reality.  it was brutal.  his voice was literally frightening – degrading is actually the best word to describe it.  i finally put my stuff down, looked him in the eye, and said “yes dad.”  and away he went and stormed back down the stairs still muttering angrily to himself.  i didn’t realize it in the moment, but that moment triggered what would become the most difficult week i think i have ever lived.this instance above occurred days before thanksgiving.  over the entirety of thanksgiving week i had one wish and it was to go to sleep and never wake up – literally die in my sleep.  i had thoughts every other day of jumping one of the bridges.  in my better states of mind i thought about running away from home.  i wanted to see no one, disappear from the radar indefinitely.  how i faked it through thanksgiving with family like everything in my life was great… i still don’t know.  suicidal people are some of the best actors it turns out.  we can fake everything.  because it’s our self-defense mechanism from ourselves.  we play everything off like it is okay, simply to divert our mind from reality which is that we literally crave death, and leaving this world of endless mental pain and suffering.  the sunday following thanksgiving i repeatedly tried sleeping the instance i woke up.  because every time i woke up, the thoughts were back.  and i would sleep again to run away.  then wake up again and they were back, more furious than ever.  then i’d sleep again.  and again.  i was desperate.my parents confronted me downstairs.  the asked what was wrong.  i choked – i couldn’t tell them.  i was afraid to tell them the truth, that my own dad was what triggered me.  so i lied and told them i wanted to end my life for over a week and a half (it was really about 5 days to that point).  dad still thought it may have had something to do with bathroom incident (bingo!!!), but in mentioning it he already started defending himself – every reason he was right, and i was wrong.  it’s like he already knew, but yet still stubbornly stood his ground about how right he was to yell at me the way he did.  i remained silent.  his defensive wall was already up waiting for my assault on his ego.  i wouldn’t stand a chance talking any sense into him.  and then the best part: they started trying to enlighten on seeking god for my problems.  yeah, like that would help!  all i could think was, “that’s the best you can do for me?”  i was a mix of sad, angry, and extremely disappointed in both of them.  i wanted to scream in their face and tell them that if i wanted to end my life that night, there wasn’t a single prayer they could utter to fucking stop me.  i called my therapist and set up an emergency appointment for the next day.i had been texting my close friends in the meantime, and they asked me if i ever thought about moving out to maybe go live with a friend rather than at home.  and i told them it wasn’t part of “the plan” (as i call my dad’s plan) which was to live at home while i pay off student loan debt.  as it stands if i were to pay off all of my debt while living at home, it would take me about 4 years.  at that time i will be 30 years old.  that’s fucking depressing in itself.  but my friends had a point.  why not move out, even if it means i pay off student debt in say, 10 years’ time instead?  yes it’s obviously not financially the greatest idea moving out and paying rent on top of college debt, but what’s the point of saving money living with my dad when i can barely save my own mental health from him?  my therapist agreed at the appointment the next day.  i need to move out.  enough is enough.  it’s not worth me risking my life to save on college debt payments.  pay a bit extra in the long haul, but at least live life in peace.  when i started thinking of it that way, i considered it worth every penny.  the other option is that i end my life and let the federal government forgive them completely (as they do in the case of death).  that option seems more and more realistic as i fall into dark depressive cycles dealing with my dad.  scary that i would actually value my student loan payments over my own life, but that’s the honest truth.  i can become just that crazy to think ending my life is a valid method to finish off the student loan payments once and for all.---present day---i’m now in the awkward transitional phase where i’m figuring out where i want to move out to with my friend, and also how the hell i’m going to break the news to my dad that i’m moving out.  i don’t want to cut ties with him like both my sisters did (my older sister moved out when she was 17, my younger sister ran away from home when she was like 20 or 21).  now i can fully understand why they both left.  it was for the sake of their own health.  and now i’m in the same situation.  my dad in every other respect is a fantastic father.  i shouldn’t portray him as the bag guy in this post because he really is an outstanding father… however he is a terrible disciplinarian.  he goes way overboard.  he is verbally abusive without even knowing or being able to grasp it after the fact.  and it has taken a mental toll on all 3 of us kids.i don’t know where i’m going with this now… i’m literally just mentally dumping my baggage on everyone it seems here.  this is an excruciatingly long post now and i apologize for that.  but i hope some of you out there who can relate with these cases of severe depression/suicidal tendencies that you will get to the root cause like i did, as soon as you can.  do not hide the truth from your own mind.  be willing to acknowledge what is right and wrong in your life, and do something to help yourselves.  do not live to please others.  do what it is right for you, like i am doing by moving out soon.  and do not fear what others’ reactions will be.  the only fear you should have is of allowing the things that control your mind to take hold of you and pull you back to the darkness that is craving suicide.  it is not the answer, though it may always seem to be the answer, as it seemed for many of my problems on multiple levels.  please take care of yourselves, and surround yourself with the right people who will be looking out for you, and have your back at all times.  people who will listen to you, encourage you, and improve your quality of life.  get away from those who do anything that brings the value of your life down.  and do not look back.peace, love, and good vibes to all,nate', tags=[916]),\n",

       " TaggedDocument(words=\"i always thought that i had depression. i'm much better now. i never had the circumstances to see a therapist or get diagnosed due to many reasons, but i did research extensively. ocd was disruptive enough to my life for a year for me to be sure that i had been affected by it on-and-off for the majority of my life. but depression... there's only vague memories of feeling existential despair, often from making sudden 'realisations' of non-existent flaws that make me an unworthy, condemnable person. i would lie on the bed, or feel frozen with doubt, or at the worst points cry. i would try to recover memories to either prove or disprove that i'm terrible, and in fact i'd just sit there and do that, or search endlessly online for information on that. the doubt of being a worthless-unworthy-terrible-person made it hard for me to enjoy anything, though i mostly functioned well and seemed even jolly in front of others, and was able to have fun on good days. i do not remember if the feelings of despair persisted for two weeks or anything, but i was probably at least a teeny bit uncomfortable on most days. (note that like all humans, my memories may be distorted here.) the rest of the despair was (much later) caused by ocd. i always thought that i had depression from these deep, dark yet distant memories. however, now that i am acquainted with more people who are actually diagnosed, i have my doubts. (1) i seemed to have 'recovered' without therapy and medication. i did change my thought patterns drastically over the years, thinking in a completely different manner, and i see how that helped, but isn't depression supposed to be... uncontrollable? perhaps it was acute and uncontrollable then, but over a long time i seemed to have 'cured myself'. (2) does depression involve reasons such as 'sudden revelations of all the bad things i've done and how worthless i am'? isn't it supposed to just creep up on you as a dark and gloomy feeling without thoughts and reasons behind, and that any subsequent thoughts are caused by depression, not causing it? (3) letting it out and going through my doubts with my family often made me feel a lot better. i don't know for how long, i usually had new worries coming, but at least it made me feel better in that instant. so perhaps i only felt despaired because of my doubts, and once they were cleared, it was better?i'm confused and frustrated. particularly since i also feel like i'm trying so hard to prove that i had/have depression. that's miserable - it's not supposed to be something to be proud of and to be used to look 'deep' and 'interesting', they say, but it's the only thing that can justify the years of near-silent suffering that i had before this. saying that i was only sad because of my silly pre-teen doubts would be an understatement, and in a sense recognising that i had struggled with mental health problems is in my identity. i feel like wouldn't be me without that. it was so terrible, and it changed me drastically no matter how much better i am now.just posting here to speak to people who are sure that they have depression, to see what they think. do point out if you think i've been wrong anywhere, i don't mind and i'll try not to get hurt, i just really want to know the truth.\", tags=[919]),\n",

managed to convince him to wait until he comes back and i\\'ll try and help him. we started dating when he came back, i thought i was in love and i could help him somehow but as time passes, i fell out of love with him and was just emotionally drained in general. i still care about him, so we kept talking after we broke up, maybe that wasn\\'t a good idea since he is in love with me and i\\'m giving him some kind of hope. i just wanted to be friends with him, but he kept saying we can\\'t be friends, so eventually i just gave up and we got back tgt again (i asked him out), i thought i could just try to love him since he\\'s a nice person deep down and we get along (i thought it might made him happier, have something to look forward to, i don\\'t know..), he has said many times that if it wasn\\'t for me he would have killed himself. he said he has nothing to lose anyways so he accepted my offer. that didn\\'t work out, i broke it off with him again a few months in when he went back to canada (part of it was because i can\\'t do long distance relationship too). and again we still maintained contact because i don\\'t want him to kill himself, and he\\'s got no one other than me, literally. he loves his mom but because they\\'re so different, they always fight about everything. he doesn\\'t talk to his dad and brother. his best friend blocked him, he doesn\\'t maintain contact with any of his former high school friends, and he says he doesn\\'t trust anyone (but me) nor rly consider anyone his friend. he had stopped going to university completely and just stay at home without talking to anyone but me online. we had mutual friends but when i see them and asked if they still talk to him, they said no, because he was too negative, they all said they\\'re living a happier life without contacting him, which i find horrible at the time and felt very angry... but, i turned out to be the same. these few days we\\'ve been constantly having small arguments, he says he can\\'t trust me anymore and he feels like i\\'m toying him, he says i\\'m distancing myself (which i guess i was since i don\\'t want him to like me or for him to get the wrong idea while still keeping contact with him), he told me i don\\'t understand the fact that he wants to kill himself everyday. i felt so awful, i didn\\'t know what to do. i told him he really need to get professional help, therapists payed thousands of dollars to study years in schools just to be able to work with people and i\\'m happy to help him with the process, but he refuses to, he says the only person he wants to talk to is me and he can\\'t trust a stranger. he says he feels like i betrayed and abandoned him since i\\'ve said all those things while we were dating like i\\'ll be there for him and now i can\\'t keep my promises. which he is right. i shouldn\\'t have said those things so lightly. i know that\\'s extremely selfish of me but i have no romantic feelings for him anymore. after those arguments, we spent a few days thinking and i\\'ve come to think that i definitely do not want him to kill himself, and he haven\\'t got anyone else but me, so i texted him and told him what i thought, he said he can\\'t live without me, so we agreed to keep contact, and i said i\\'ll try to stop distancing myself, and be as natural and \"normal\" as possible. it was alright for a few days, but then yesterday i followed a guy i used to like on instagram which is also a person that he despises, and he talked to me about him before. it pissed him off that i disregard all the bad things about he had told me about the guy i used to like that at the time i acknowledged and listened to him, but now i prove to him that i lied to him since i still want to follow the other guy. that sets me off too and i had a rage saying that i\\'m sick of him analyzing every single thing i do, i\\'m sick of him stalking me on every social media (he admitted that he does that), that i can do whatever i want, and it\\'s none of his business, in anger i just said i don\\'t want to contact him anymore because i\\'m spent and i have no feelings for him anymore and nothing matters. after fighting for a while and everything sort of were settling down i was telling him i\\'m a rotten person deep down and just because he thinks i\\'m better than the rest i\\'m really not, and i suggest him blaming me for making everything worse than it should\\'ve been (because i truly believe so, i deeply regret what i\\'ve done to him, and my mindset that what i was doing was the best was fucked up), only to leave him in the end like everyone else, he says he knows all of those bad things ab me and he still think i\\'m less rotten than them, then he finally says alright, thank you for giving me the feeling of hope, etc. and blocked me right away. it\\'s been a day from that now and even though i don\\'t love him anymore, i can\\'t stop thinking about if what i did was the right thing or not, what if he kills himself and i was the one capable of stopping it but i\\'m just too selfish to just try conversing with him for a while until he can come back home. right now i still can\\'t believe i actually said that, i\\'ve always thought about stop contacting him one day but never thought that i would actually do it. i left him when he needs me the most... but at the same time i have no feelings for him anymore. i was thinking of going to his house (his parent\\'s house here, not in canada) and actually telling his mom about his condition, maybe she\\'ll listen, he wouldn\\'t want me doing that, but even if i don\\'t talk to him anymore i don\\'t want him to die and maybe she could do something about it. anyways that\\'s besides the point. i\\'m sorry that this is extremely long,

       "['i\\'m not really expecting sympathy as i know what i did was wrong.  note, this is going to be long lol.so basically i\\'ve been seeing this guy online for three months now and we instantly hit it off.  we were texting each other constantly everyday but little did he know that i was actually a catfish who posed as a pretty cute person who was just camera shy.  this was my first time catfishing and instantly after a day of doing it i deleted my account from the dating site but kept in contact with him without telling him who i was.  now, this \"relationship\" lasted through november and december which were both of our exam months which gave me the perfect excuse to why i couldn\\'t meet him since we both live in the same area.  he was the perfect guy to me, we shared stories, our feelings, and talked about what we did on that day.  he was everything that i wanted to be; he was sporty, popular, and talented.  what made me fall for him though was that he was so supportive during my exams were he would actually take his time for a couple hours and tutor me.over time i just stopped sending him photos and he didn\\'t care he thought i was just shy, but in reality my guilt was just building up.  i wanted to tell him badly but before i did i sought help on subreddits such as r/amiugly and others to get a sense of how i looked.  obviously, this was a major mistake on my part and resulted in a major blow in my confidence levels.  i was a wreak, and still am.i told him i was a catfish 3 days ago and to my surprise he took it really well and forgave me really well, he actually complimented me on how i was such a good catfish.  to my surprise he confessed that he also catfishes other people, but instead he catfishes people for fun.  this was going great.  **until** he confessed that he had a boyfriend all a long and he was pretty promiscuous; but this thought never would have crossed my mind.  i showed him my real photos and he rated me a a 5.5/10.  i was completely average to him, i was \"not too bad\".  he wanted to remain friends and so i did. the consequences?  honestly, i think i\\'ve been let off easier than most people but a part of me wishes he just totally broke ties with me.  this was my first relationship that felt meaningful with a person.  looking at his pictures kills me inside and i haven\\'t talked to him for 2 days now.  i feel empty and alone.  the nightly ritual that we once had of talking from 11 pm to 4 am was gone.  i don\\'t know what to do; this catfishing scheme only resulted in many many insecurities.  i think i\\'ve fallen into depression; i feel lonely, jealous of his life, ugly, inadequate.  on top of this is other things like my joblessness.  i find myself comparing my life with his, he was everything i wanted to be.  i\\'m not sure if i should even still talk to him.  i find myself thinking about him every minute of my day.  i know i can never compete with his boyfriend, he is un reachable now.this will be my first and last time catfishing.  i\\'m not sure if this is the effects of losing a friend, having my first \"breakup\", being called extremely average, or both.  thanks for reading my rant if you\\'re still here lol.  if you\\'re the one i catfished, sorry again... i really wish to talk like we used to.  this is a horrible way to celebrate the new year... a part of me wishes that i had confessed after my christmas break to remain happy just a little longer...ps.  for those who are confused, i\\'m a guy too.**tl;dr** i catfished another guy, fell in love after he supported me for so long.  i confessed; found out he had a boyfriend all a long and that he thinks i\\'m average af.  i\\'m depressed now after my first breakup because i miss him and never can get him.',\n",
       " \"okay, so here is the entire situation.growing up my 24m brother was bullied horribly by his peers and even at home my dad was like your typical asian dad and would be strict with him as he did not get good grades.my dad would often say that he did not care if my brother had serious health issues so long as he got good grades and never gave him any freedom be it being up late or getting up a bit late in the morning.hence i became his only source of comfort and he used to talk to me and make me laugh.now with me, i had a pretty sociable personality and without blowing my trumpet can say that i was pretty and had excellent grades and because of this my dad was very lenient to me and gave me freedom.now my brother when he was 16 and i was 13 came to me with a weird request. he said he was already name called and did not want people taunting him that his little sister was ahead of him even at dating and hence wanted me to put off dating till we passed high school.he said at that time that he knew his request was unreasonable but told me that since i was going to be pretty and would have guys asking me out and once i turned 18 or 19, he would help me out in my selection ( with my choice being a priority ) and would also in the meantime come out of his shell.i flatly refused and said that i wanted to date a boy ( whom he had never even seen ) and experience hs lifethat's it.he stopped talking to me from that day and i never made that much of an effort.after my first break up, i was asked out by the most popular by of hs who i later realized was the ringleader of the group of the gang that targeted my brother.i promptly broke up with him and apologized to my brother who said that it further reinforced of his feelings of detest he had of me.his says that ever since i started going out, his bullying increased even further and he felt that i had put my social life ar more than his comforthe moved out when he turned 18 and could not make anything of his life,he has since then been depressed, angry and had had trouble getting up in the morning and stay outside of the house for more than hour or two,my dad cannot bear the humiliation that his own son is a bum started taunting him as a shameless loser and this made him get a part time jobhe lives alone in a damp dingy apartment and my father and me pay him money per month and he also earns from part time job.now i thought once school life is over, he would help me out, talk to me and have the same relationship as beforeboy was i wrong.he wants nothing to do with both me and my father, he says that bar financial help, he does not even want to look at me and feels that both me and my dad have screwed his life up.he says that to me he admits he is being a bit unfair, but says that he always wished i had heeded to his request and maybe postponed of my dating life.i thought after 4 years of non-contact time would have healed his wounds but boy he still cannot get over it. i could easily cut of his financial supply and have thought of this option so the he atleast can come live with me but did not go through with this.he says he will never talk to me and forgive me and my dad even when we turn 50 and would not even come to my dad's burial if and when he passes away.says he regrets having a younger sis and wished for atleast an elder sis or a younger brother.i do not know what to do as i was okay with cutting of for 4 years but cannot stay away for another year or 2. do i cut him off financially and let him suffer ( atleast he would understand how i help him)also my dad too does not care and considers him a major failure\",\n",
       " 'hi everyone, first things first i hope everyone have a fantastic 2018 around your friends and familymoving to my story. so, i met this friend through youtube in 2012 since he was a portuguese gaming youtuber for adults (due to his language and way of talk) which i enjoyed a lot. i got the chance to start talking with him late 2015 and alongside a couple more viewers, old friends of him and his girlfriend, we were a group of 7 to 8 elements that throughout 2016 we usually hangout a lot on teamspeak (group voice chat) playing games and talking about life and stuff... it got very intimate my conversasions with him, told almost my whole life to him, about my sad past and he told me all his lifestrories too. through 2016 it was all amazing... but mid 2017 our group started breaking apart, 2 of us stepped away (which i joined them later) 1 disappeared due to uni stuff which i respect,  his girlfriend was left almost alone (which i will explain next), and him which joined a new group of paying-friends (which i will explain too) so, apparantly he was doing youtube only as a hobbie and every cent he took from there in publicity was just a \"way to thank him\" for the amazing job he did. he had about 10k views per day on his videos but due to youtube polices he wasn\\'t earning enough to make a living of that, but it was helping playing his bills. so he decided to move to twitch,  which is a live streaming platform focused for gamers. he was quite a success there and started making quite some cash on donations and monthly supporting subscriptions...later he started leaving our group and started talking more with the ones who were giving him the money (top donators)  instead of his friends who were never with him for the money...he left us, we asked him why,  and his awenser was that us refused to join him, which was half true, because i personally didn\\'t wanted to join and secondly he was the one leaving. i started noticing that his girlfriend was getting sad,  by posting sad songs over and over on her facebook, and i started asking if was something wrong, and she trusted me that the relationship wasn\\'t going well (after 3 years together), he was spenting less and less time with here, starting with excuses to not visit her personally and stuff like that. during that time in october i got a bombshell, his girlfriend told me that he told her that met one of his female subscribers on twitch personaly and \"just\" kissed her,  cheating on my friend/his girlfriend...i don\\'t know why she forgived him, even after that he didn\\'t changed his attitude,  he continues flirting every girl that pops on his stream...i was the one supporting her through this rough time, trying to cheer her up in every chance i got, playing with her,  watching some videos and stuff... she was thankful to me, and i was like \"thats what real friends do right?\". but between me and him,  he just started to ignore me more and more,  he had time to play with his paying friends but to awenser a simple \"hello\"  from me took weeks.like,  i\\'m not obcessed with him,  i\\'m just truely disaponted with him and his atittude... swapping friends for money,  and leave his girlfriend suffering all the time... i exploded... i couldn\\'t hold this anymore,  so,  i decided to let know every single paying supporter of his stream know,  to what type of person they are giving the money to...how? just with simple \"memes\" (images with text) comparing him to dr. disrespect (one of the biggest twitch streamers who admited publicly he cheated om his wife,  and had the balls to stoo streaming to solve his issues). i criticized my friend for only caring about the money and putting that over his girlfriend that loves him more then everything even after he cheated on her... what happened next was: he blocked me everywhere instead of asking me why i did such thing,  since he didn\\'t did that,  i asume that i asume that i wasn\\'t a friend for him anymore, and decided to run away and delete me from everywhere. the thing is now everyone knows what type of person he his, and let them know if someone with even more money comes,  they can be left behind. but since now my ex friend doesn\\'t want to lose his funding (since he now lives from donations makong it a full time job). i don\\'t want the other to happen what happened to me... am i regreted of what i done? nope! the only \"if\"  point here was how his girlfriend reacted after i did this... i clearly see that she was sad,  and things could have been solved other way without exposing his life,  which i disagree, i exposed one thing about his life,  so the way she meant was the life as a whole,  which i didn\\'t exposedshe is the only reason that this is upsetting me... i have 0 regrets on him,  but on her... i never wanted her to be sad at me because of this...  never was my intention... this is my first post here... just wanted to share my story,  if theres something you guys missunderstood due to my average english,  please comment below,  i really wanted to get this out of me...  if readed till the end... thanks :) ',\n",
       " \"i'm here to share my feelings. what does it mean when you get a sudden pang of sadness that refuses to leave n leaves you wanting to cry for now reason?  i've googled it and it's given me three reasons 1. hormonal imbalance. 2. anemia.3. depression. let me tell you a bit about myself. i'm li, female, 20 years old. i've had my fair share of ups and downs in life. i was in a bad relationship for almost a year before i found the person i actually wanted to be with. but the situation in which i got into a relationship with him was rough you could say.  you see he was my best friend and i didn't want to loose him. he'd liked me for almost 2 years at that time and i knew i'd loose him forever if i kept him waiting.  but know i'm very happy i did because it's the best thing that ever happened to me.the person before him, was the worst choice of my life, but not the first worst choice.  i've made two wrong choices in life that i regret. 1. my ex. initially all was fine and i liked the time we shared together. my feelings started to get strong until i was stuck in a place where i thought i couldn't be able to live without him. but sadly his feelings were the total opposite. as time went by he started losing interest. he did cheat on me, three times. i was stupid to keep on giving chances to him. he knew i was all his and maybe that's why he started taking me for granted. and that's when things got bad. i know i'm not a good person and i've done some things too but i'm sure i was all loyal.he started getting abusive. valentine's day '14. i was 16. we lived 6 bus stops away and it took time to get to him. traffic made it take even longer . when i got there he was pissed because i took so much time. he grabbed me by the arm and started calling me names i'd gotten used to at that point. we walked until we reached darker and empty streets. we didn't talk to each other. we held hands. his grip was tight, squeezing my fingers together. we reached a house that looked like it was empty. all the lights were out. it wasn't his house, just a random house. we went in through the gate and to the side of the house so that it hid us from the main road and from any neighbouring house. basically we were hidden from the world.  he started kissing me hard. his hands were on my shoulders. i was pinned to the wall. i tried to move but he was heavier than me, even though he was as skinny as a stick. i was uncomfortable. i didn't kiss him back. he got pissed, called me a slut, said i was cheating on him. the usual. then it came. the first slap. it was hard and sudden and unexpected. i didn't know what was happening. i was crying at that point. my mouth was shut with his hand. his other hand moved down. kissing me on my neck now, biting and sucking . i'd had enough i wanted to go home. i told him to stop. i'd had enough, i kept telling him to stop. he didn't. but i didn't stop.  he got irritated i guess or idk. came more slaps. and a final push to the wall. and he walked away.. i didn't know my way back home, my way to the bus stop that would take me home. i was alone. my heart was crying. i found my way back, went home. texted him again and again apologizing. i thought he hated me i thought he'd break up. i couldn't bear that idea. i was in a bad place. \",\n",
       " 'this is quite a lot, but i really hope at least one person will read through. this means the world to me.he\\'s a great person. he constantly puts others over himself and he treats me amazingly. this is the man i can see a future with, and he does too. but his depression and anxiety causes him to act in ways he didn\\'t intend, and it affects the relationship negatively. for example, sometimes he doesn\\'t seem enthusiastic to do many things, he has a negative attitude on just about everything, and loses motivation to do anything except stay home. he constantly has anxiety attacks, and often misses classes because it is so bad and he can\\'t get out of bed. it\\'s been like this since the beginning, and i\\'ve tried everything to support him. i stay with him through the attacks, i try to give him motivation to get out of bed, and i constantly shower him with love and appreciation.it started to affect me as well. i started having panic attacks and feeling quite depressed all the time. it\\'s caused me to break up with him about 2 months ago, as i decided that maybe this isn\\'t in my best interest since it\\'s been affecting me so negatively. i didn\\'t want to constantly be brought down, and knew that i would have to deal with this for the rest of my life if i wanted to stay with him.after a week of talking it out after the breakup, we decided to just take a 2 month break and work on ourselves and problems in our relationship. i had self image problems, wasn\\'t very patient, and could be quite stubborn sometimes, and it certainly affected how i treated him and the problems in our relationship. taking care of him also made me forget about self-care. i\\'m better than ever, have improved on myself, made friends and stopped being so reliant on him, and i feel ready to go back in with a more positive outlook on myself and the relationship. however, it is still very hard for him, and although i feel like i\\'ve improved and changed tremendously over the course of 2 months, he\\'s still struggling to be more positive and achieve his goals (eat healthier, lose weight, etc). i don\\'t want to be the only person who has reached a great place, only to find that he\\'s still stuck in such a negative place.he was on antidepressants, but they made it so much worse and made him suicidal. i\\'ve tried to get him to go to therapy, he says he hates therapists and that they don\\'t help/make it worse. he\\'s had bad experiences and i\\'ve tried to ask him if we could go together, if we could at least try once, but he won\\'t budge. i\\'ve gifted him a self-help book about depression, i\\'ve tried to give him little advices about things he could do that have helped other people, but he gets very upset and tells me \"it doesn\\'t work like that\" and doesn\\'t want me to help. i\\'ve tried to do the things he wants to accomplish with him, such as asking him if we wants to go for a walk with me, or i\\'ll ask if he wants to go workout with me. the only thing i can do now is let him handle it on his own (as that\\'s what he\\'s asked me to do), and although he at least now has hope for himself, he doesn\\'t seem to want to do much or believe many things will help. he hates when i bring things up like \"science has shown that...\" and gets upset. how do i get him to at least try things?i know that hidden underneath the mental health problems is an energetic and amazing person, as it shows through all the time. he\\'s told me that when he was younger, he used to be extremely hyper and the complete opposite, but as he got older and his mental illness got worse, he started becoming more mellow and less enthusiastic about things.there has to be something i\\'m missing to be able to communicate with him more effectively. i know that you can\\'t love someone\\'s depression away. i\\'m not asking how i can get rid of it, i just want advice on how i can help him take steps to help it at least. there\\'s countless people who have found a way to cope with their depression, and i want him to be able to too. i know it won\\'t happen right away, but i think with small steps it could be manageable.tl;dr: my boyfriend\\'s depression is ruining our relationship and causing many problems. i\\'ve been on a journey of self-improvement myself, and have learned a lot that i believe can help him. what can i do to help, and how can i get him to actually try to better himself when he doesn\\'t want to do anything to help himself?',\n",
       " \"i think that's part of my problem, i try so hard to be positive, and i do succeed, but only superficially, really it all feels fake and not me so i want to be true to myself but that means being a miserable piece of shit that hates everyone who tries to help him because he's so confused in his own head that he doesn't know what he wants, what will help or his own feelings\",\n",
       " \"so guess who won't sleep because i'm scared he might do something stupid and he lives in another country!!!!!!!! someone help me fix this. \",\n",
       " \"so i've been friends with this guy for some time, and he's always been a bit flirty with me. a few days ago we were suppose to hang out with another friend but they couldn't make it so it was just us too. it felt like somewhat of a date, he wanted to pay for the food we ate but i felt bad and pitched in 10 dollars. he's a sweet guy but can be a bit of a douche to others in public (i think he mostly sarcastic but i feel like thats him building a wall you know to protect himself and etc). i was really starting to like him but now idk i feel like i'm looking for anything that he's done that has either bothered me or i didn't like to give me a reason to push him away and etc. at the beginning of meeting him i didn't like him but as i got to know him he's a pretty good guy, just has a wall and seems to treat me nicer than he treats some other people. i just don't know what to do. i feel like i'm sabotaging myself from actually having someone who cares about me and who could finally love me. i feel as though i am just sabotaging myself from what i've been wanting all along.\",\n",

       " \"i opened up a bit and he seemed concern for a while before rambling about his own life and issues. he has faced many hardships i know that..but my issues are too intense and it shows on my face and in my personality. i know i am not the most unluckiest person and many people are worse off than me but that does not help at all.  he wanted me to go to someplace with him and he said he'll be bored as hell there. i had to finally tell him that i am exhausted and i need some space. i have been pushing myself and been doing everything he wants me to do for a while now and now i just couldn't push myself anymore so i told him i can't come.  he rambled on about the issues he has faced in life so far and kept asking me to come otherwise he'll be bored as hell over there. to me, it seemed a weak reason and instead of understanding me they just cared about their own selfish goal.  he kept asking and i kept declining. he later even called and i asked my mom to say that he was exhausted and he fell asleep as soon as he came home.  i felt incredibly guilty afterwards. i feel bad for saying no but i just had to say it because i honestly needed some space. i needed to do it but i am feeling so guilty now.\",\n",

       " 'recently, one of my very best friend committed suicide. though i hate that terminology, \"committed.\" like he\\'s convicted of a crime. he lost the war.. he died, he\\'s dead, he passed away, he\\'s gone. and he shouldn\\'t be. he was just here, we\\'ve been best friends since fourth grade. him, me and another friend of ours. the three nachos we\\'ve called ourselves since then. as silly as it is, we\\'ve had a pact to always be friends and to always be there for each other. he\\'s been struggling with addiction, depression, anxiety and a stupid manipulative girl that we are holding responsible for his death. (that\\'s another story, that i just can\\'t get through with a level head.)i guess i should say \"struggled.\".. but i haven\\'t accepted that he\\'s really gone. we were too late. he promised to always reach out, but this one time he didn\\'t. and i was in a different time zone and saw his snapchat story and then he was gone. it was \"facebook\" official. it wasn\\'t a joke, it wasn\\'t a dramatic ploy, he\\'s gone. he is gone. he\\'s not here. and i just can\\'t accept it. i couldn\\'t stop it. i know he made his choice and that\\'s why he didn\\'t reach out. he wanted to go, and people keep saying \"he\\'s in a better place\", \"he\\'s not suffering anymore.\" no, no, no. that\\'s not helpful. his suffering is now divided among those who loved him. the world doesn\\'t stop. time doesn\\'t stop. people need it to stop, they need to process, they need to mourn.how does everything keep going when someone passes? i just lost my uncle t, just one month ago. and i lost my friend barely two weeks ago, but things keeps going. life keeps going without them. and it frustrates me because the world just lost these people. they may not have been important to everyone but they were important to me. doesn\\'t that count?how do you grieve? how do you mourn? how do you process what just happened?

       " 'i can\\'t trust my friends and family\\'s judgement since they\\'re thinking for me and it is biased, i need to get some outsiders\\' opinions. i hope you\\'ll be able to give me your honest opinion on my dilemma. this is going to be really long, i apologize, my thoughts are extremely scattered atm. my ex-boyfriend was and is very suicidal. we knew each other before, we played in the same band but didn\\'t know a lot ab each other. we only started becoming close friends when he left to canada to study. he was gonna kill himself in canada, and back then, i managed to convince him to wait until he comes back and i\\'ll try and help him. we started dating when he came back, i thought i was in love and i could help him somehow but as time passes, i fell out of love with him and was just emotionally drained in general. i still care about him, so we kept talking after we broke up, maybe that wasn\\'t a good idea since he is in love with me and i\\'m giving him some kind of hope. i just wanted to be friends with him, but he kept saying we can\\'t be friends, so eventually i just gave up and we got back tgt again (i asked him out), i thought i could just try to love him since he\\'s a nice person deep down and we get along (i thought it might made him happier, have something to look forward to, i don\\'t know..), he has said many times that if it wasn\\'t for me he would have killed himself. he said he has nothing to lose anyways so he accepted my offer. that didn\\'t work out, i broke it off with him again a few months in when he went back to canada (part of it was because i can\\'t do long distance relationship too). and again we still maintained contact because i don\\'t want him to kill himself, and he\\'s got no one other than me, literally. he loves his mom but because they\\'re so different, they always fight about everything. he doesn\\'t talk to his dad and brother. his best friend blocked him, he doesn\\'t maintain contact with any of his former high school friends, and he says he doesn\\'t trust anyone (but me) nor rly consider anyone his friend. he had stopped going to university completely and just stay at home without talking to anyone but me online. we had mutual friends but when i see them and asked if they still talk to him, they said no, because he was too negative, they all said they\\'re living a happier life without contacting him, which i find horrible at the time and felt very angry... but, i turned out to be the same. these few days we\\'ve been constantly having small arguments, he says he can\\'t trust me anymore and he feels like i\\'m toying him, he says i\\'m distancing myself (which i guess i was since i don\\'t want him to like me or for him to get the wrong idea while still keeping contact with him), he told me i don\\'t understand the fact that he wants to kill himself everyday. i felt so awful, i didn\\'t know what to do. i told him he really need to get professional help, therapists payed thousands of dollars to study years in schools just to be able to work with people and i\\'m happy to help him with the process, but he refuses to, he says the only person he wants to talk to is me and he can\\'t trust a stranger. he says he feels like i betrayed and abandoned him since i\\'ve said all those things while we were dating like i\\'ll be there for him and now i can\\'t keep my promises. which he is right. i shouldn\\'t have said those things so lightly. i know that\\'s extremely selfish of me but i have no romantic feelings for him anymore. after those arguments, we spent a few days thinking and i\\'ve come to think that i definitely do not want him to kill himself, and he haven\\'t got anyone else but me, so i texted him and told him what i thought, he said he can\\'t live without me, so we agreed to keep contact, and i said i\\'ll try to stop distancing myself, and be as natural and \"normal\" as possible. it was alright for a few days, but then yesterday i followed a guy i used to like on instagram which is also a person that he despises, and he talked to me about him before. it pissed him off that i disregard all the bad things about he had told me about the guy i used to like that at the time i acknowledged and listened to him, but now i prove to him that i lied to him since i still want to follow the other guy. that sets me off too and i had a rage saying that i\\'m sick of him analyzing every single thing i do, i\\'m sick of him stalking me on every social media (he admitted that he does that), that i can do whatever i want, and it\\'s none of his business, in anger i just said i don\\'t want to contact him anymore because i\\'m spent and i have no feelings for him anymore and nothing matters. after fighting for a while and everything sort of were settling down i was telling him i\\'m a rotten person deep down and just because he thinks i\\'m better than the rest i\\'m really not, and i suggest him blaming me for making everything worse than it should\\'ve been (because i truly believe so, i deeply regret what i\\'ve done to him, and my mindset that what i was doing was the best was fucked up), only to leave him in the end like everyone else, he says he knows all of those bad things ab me and he still think i\\'m less rotten than them, then he finally says alright, thank you for giving me the feeling of hope, etc. and blocked me right away. it\\'s been a day from that now and even though i don\\'t love him anymore, i can\\'t stop thinking about if what i did was the right thing or not, what if he kills himself and i was the one capable of stopping it but i\\'m just too selfish to just try conversing with him for a while until he can come back home. right now i still can\\'t believe i actually said that, i\\'ve always thought about stop contacting him one day but never thought that i would actually do it. i left him when he needs me the most... but at the same time i have no feelings for him anymore. i was thinking of going to his house (his parent\\'s house here, not in canada) and actually telling his mom about his condition, maybe she\\'ll listen, he wouldn\\'t want me doing that, but even if i don\\'t talk to him anymore i don\\'t want him to die and maybe she could do something about it. anyways that\\'s besides the point. i\\'m sorry that this is extremely long, my thoughts are all over the place. do you think what i did was wrong? please tell me if it really is, i really, really need to know, because this will be the biggest mistake i\\'ll ever make if what i did is truly not the brightest, i know i am extremely selfish but i could\\'ve tried harder... personally, i can\\'t trust my own judgement but this heavy, heavy guilt i\\'m feeling must say something. thank you for taking out the time to read this. have a great day.',\n",
       " 'i’m not suicidal at the moment. just having some horrifying thoughts.. like i’m only hanging on by a loose thread and anything might break it.. but i’m holding onto that little thread for my life.. looking for any reason to live.. anyway i’m turning 18 soon and have been depressed since i was 12. i recently stopped taking my mood stabilizers and antidepressants and i’m starting to think that wasn’t the best idea. a couple weeks ago i tried to overdose on 1,200 mg of lamotrogine but threw it up.. it wasn’t the first time i tried to overdose to kill myself.when i was 16 i started dating a 26 year old. we are still together and i am in love with him but i don’t think he feels the same. don’t give me “he’s a pedo” bullshit because he’s not..but the thing is. he’s abusive. he has hit me, choked me out, etc.he’s homophobic and i dated a female in the past and used to identify as pansexual but had to stop because he hates gays. he hates transgenders and i identify as non binary but he will never know that because he won’t accept it. he gets mad over everything i do. a couple days ago he called me evil because i believe you should neuter or spay your animals to avoid more being put in the shelter or on the streets. he’s called me evil in front of his son..but a few days ago he told his son i was a better person than he was. when i try to talk about my depression he thinks i’m just trying to get attention.. but he’s my only friend.. the only person i have to talk about this kind of shit. if i left him he wouldn’t care.. he would say “there’s the door” he called me a pill popper when i tried to overdose. he hates vegans and vegetarians because it’s a “trend” although i have been vegetarian for almost four years except a while back i ate shrimp because i thought it would make him proud.i’m not allowed to have a job, friends, anything. my life revolves around him. i gave up cigarettes, being a cheerleader, all my friends for him. i had one slip up. i went to a party without permission a few months ago and he found out and there was hell to pay that i am still paying for.he won’t let me touch his phone but he can go through mine whenever he likes. today a random number tried to contact me and he asked me who it was and i said i didn’t know. he said “you have five minutes to find out” turns out it was a black girl in my grade. he was pissed because she’s black. what i don’t understand is, his sons mother is mixed... he told me months ago he still loves her. i’ve never met her but i know she’s beautiful. athletic. everything i will never be. i found a hair tye in his bed that definetly wasn’t mine because i have short hair which he thinks i look like a dyke because of it.. but that’s one thing i’m not going to change for him.. i never see my mom but every christmas i go see her and my family but i didn’t this year because he said he’d break up with me. my mom asked me when graduation was but i couldn’t make myself tell her i wasn’t going to graduate because when i turn 18 i’m going to be homeschooled because that’s what the boyfriend wants for me.. i’m truly giving up everything for him and he doesn’t see that or care. all he sees is a whore.. once he told me he hates how materialistic i am. but i’ve had the same wardrobe for like three years and don’t give a shit about brands. i always go for the cheapest bargain. he will only wear name brand. the hottest jordan’s. only american eagle jeans. he literally buys jordan’s every few months. and i wear four year old combat boots with holes in the bottom. he does buy me new clothes and shit but i don’t ask for it and i literally give no fucks about how expensive it is. his reasoning for calling me materialistic because i like bleaching my hair. which costs like ten dollars because i don’t even go to the salon because im wise with my money and go for the cheapest option. how the fuck am i materialistic.it’s like he’s trying to sculpt me into some perfect woman that i can never fucking be. i’m not an active bitch. i have an average body (think skinny-fat) like i’m pretty thin but i have extra fat in my thighs, butt, and a little bit on my stomach. i’m a “recovered” anorexic and am now at a healthy weight of 130 and the lowest i’ve got to is 110 and i know that’s not bad but it’s a big deal to me. anyway, i’ve been going to the gym, being active and shit, running. i fucking hate running more than any other activity. but i do it for him to make him proud but it’s still not good enough. he judges me. he judges me that i can’t run for very long without getting tired and feeling like i’m having a heart attack. nothing is fucking good enough.there’s so much more.. but i can’t think straight and i can’t leave him so why does it even matterwe adopted a dog that we’re picking up tomorrow for my christmas present so i feel even more unable to leave him.. he’s also getting weed tomorrow which i think i actually need to be sane. he’ll give me some, but sometimes get mad if i smoke it. he’s straight edge. even if those things weren’t happening tomorrow i know i could never leave him. but maybe this dog will give me a reason to live.. because right now if a truck was about to hit me, i wouldn’t jump out of the way. my death would be a relief to not only myself but also him because i’ll never deserve himedit: today we wake up and he asks “do you want donuts or something” keyword or something. i said “i just want a red bull” because i don’t feel like eating as soon as i wake up i never do and i’ve told him that before but obviously he doesn’t care. he gets mad and leaves saying “i asked if you fucking wanted something to eat and you ask for an energy drink” yeah sorry if i eat in the morning i feel nauseous. like you

       " 'hey guys, so i’ve just lost my best friend this year. it turns out that he didn’t really care that much for me after all. we were besties for 11+ years and promised to support each other for the rest of our lives no matter what. but lately, after he’s moved to singapore and has started dating someone, he’s changed. i mean, honestly i am truly happy for him as now we both have significant others. but he’s not like he used to be anymore...it all started this year when he forgot my birthday in august eventhough it was clearly set in his phone’s calendar as a reminder. if it were anyone else, i wouldn’t have minded. but he’s my best bud and i finally let it go. later on, he started ignoring my texts. we don’t text everyday mind you. just once or twice every two weeks to check in on each other (we’re supportive like that) but then he started replying really late or not at all unless he was in the mood. and i let that go. then when i’m really depressed and need someone to talk to, he always claims he’s busy and only calls when he’s really alone/lonely or when he wants to talk to me, in which i would always make time for him. and i let that go. all our conversations were beginning to become very shallow and i should have read the tell tale signs.the last straw came this week when i texted him on monday and he left the message un-replied for so long i decided to ask him what’s up today via instagram pms. and he just told me that he changed his number but have not let anyone else know and yet his instagram stories show him hanging out with friends of “less importance than me” whom he obviously texted/called cuz they’re halfway across town. i have been there for him through the darkest times of his life and all i want is for him to show the same support for me. but it feels as if he was using me all along and now that he doesn’t need me, i’m just tossed aside like unwanted trash. yet he still claims we’re the bestest of friends.i have decided to let him go although it’ll hurt me after all the ups and downs we’ve been through together throughout the years and the worst part is that i had to do it thru instagram cuz he didn’t even have the courtesy of giving me his phone number after explaining that he changed it. so, can anyone please be my friend? i don’t ask for much. just an honest friendship.',\n",

(i’m actually a straight guy who never thought of liking a guy, mind you). things were going great, we hung out a lot (once a week), talked everyday, and made each other happy. i felt a connection between us. then when i had to leave the tech school, he had to go to college. we became distant. i got my first job while also being in high school so i had no time, him also. we stopped texting. well a few months ago, out of the blue, he texts me saying, “hey wanna hang out? i haven’t seen you in forever!” me being the passionate one says “yes man i would love to.” then he responds with “cool. wanna come over?” i’ve never actually been to his house let alone have i ever thought about going. so i go ahead and respond with, “yeah sure man. i’m on my way.” so we sat in his living room watching tv when out of nowhere he says “lance, i really like you.” he turns to me and kisses my cheek. i froze, literally couldn’t move. i didn’t know what to do. i had no feelings for him in that kind of way. and then he kisses my lips. that drove me over the edge (in a “good” way). i kiss him back. “what am i doing?” i said to myself as we were kissing. after about 2 minutes i stood up and went to the bathroom. i cried for about 5 minutes. i told him i had to go, so i left. well just last week, he told me that he wanted to talk about what happened. i casually accepted because maybe he didn’t mean to. so when i got to his house, we sat on his bed and talked. then when we got to what happened that night, i started shaking. but then he put his hand on my knee and i stopped shaking. i forgot what he said but it made me feel so special to him. i couldn’t resist him anymore. we ended up having sex (don’t worry, he made sure it’s what i wanted). i ended up spending the night as his house. he held me so tight all night and kissed my head periodically. i left that morning in love with him. i don’t know how because i thought i was straight. well i tried texting him hours after leaving his house, but i got no response. i texted him everyday in expect of a response, but i had no luck. about a couple days ago, he texts me saying “i want nothing serious”. never have i ever been so heartbroken, back-stabbed, and depressed at once before. i have been feeling so insecure and suicidal lately... i don’t know what to do.',\n",
       " 'warning: wall of text.where do i even start?last year around this time, i went over to a friend\\'s house (both of us male. i was a junior in high school and he was a senior) to study for a test. and by friend, i mean we were classmates and we really hadn\\'t hanged out before then. so after about an hour of studying we just get to talking about random stuff and somehow we ended up holding hands. also, he had a girlfriend of 5 years at the time. when we held hands, i kind of felt like butterflies in my stomach or whatever, just really warm. over the next few days, we started to get close. we talked about literally everything. he felt like a best friend to me. the next time i came over, the first thing i said was \"can we hold hands?\" and he laughed and said sure. so that happened. and then over the next few days we got even closer. and shared more information with each other. i started to feel attracted and close to him. eventually i told him that, explaining that i had feelings for him and didn\\'t mean to have led him on or anything. and he told me he had feelings back.so the next time i come over, i ask \"can we kiss? i know it\\'s wrong and it would be cheating, but...\" and he goes \"i guess.\" and we kiss. for about 4 hours.repeat the more texting and getting closerthe next time i come over, we\\'re kissing and cuddling and having a great time. i decided to spend the night. at about 1 in the morning, he goes \"can i put my hand down your pants?\" and i say yes and it eventually turns into sex. also, he still has a girlfriend of 5 years at the time this was happening. but he had shared before that he didn\\'t know what he was sexually and he had told his girlfriend that he had no sexual attraction for her.anyway, he eventually breaks up with his girlfriend, but not just because of me. he told her about how college was coming up and he didn\\'t think long distance was a good idea and that they are better off as friends anyway. so they break up and i ask him to be my boyfriend a few days later and he says yes.also, all of this so far happened over the course of about 3 weeks.so me and him were officially dating as of january 4, 2017. he made me so happy. i literally saw a future with him. he was perfect to me. we happily dated for months. when it was summer time, he spent a lot of time with his graduated friends and we grew a little distant. i hanged out with my friends who were still in high school while he hanged out with his graduated friends before they all go their separate ways. fast forward to the end of july. me and my boyfriend were still very much in love. we spent the night at eachother\\'s houses most days of the week. but still a little distant because he hanged out with his friends. i don\\'t know exactly what happened but i started to feel some kind of romantic feelings for one of my friends. i thought they would go away but they didn\\'t. i confessed to that friend and he said he had a crush on me too. but i still dearly loved my boyfriend. so i tell him that i\\'ve been having feelings for this other guy and i don\\'t know what to do. and it turns into a talk and we break up, after dating for 7 months. he actually said that he had been meaning to break up for a while because he was going to college and he would be 5 hours away. he said he couldn\\'t do long distance and he didn\\'t need a relationship as he was trying to adjust to college life.so of course i cried that day but the next day i try and work things out with the guy i had a crush on. 4 days later he tells me \"we should just be friends.\" boom. 2 heartbreaks in a week.so for the past 4 months, i\\'ve been crying and super sad over my first boyfriend. i want him more than anything. he\\'s the love of my life. but wait... the story gets better.3 days ago, he came to spend the day with me. we were still very good friends after the breakup. he told me (long before 3 days ago) that he had gotten over me in 3 weeks. i, however, have been struggling for 4 months. i had just started to feel a little better. anyways, he comes to spend the day with me, stuff happens, and it turns out that he has to spend the night at my house. i thought i would be fine with it. it\\'s just my ex staying at my house, i can handle it. as we both go to sleep i have an uncontrollable urge to just hug him and cuddle the whole night. i literally felt sick to my stomach and couldn\\'t sleep because i couldn\\'t do anything. i eventually drift to sleep and in the middle of the night i woke up and went to cuddle him. and he cuddles me back. i wake up at 7 and decide to hold his hand. while he is asleep. for 2 hours. when he woke up, i asked \"is it okay if i keep hugging you?\" and he goes \"i guess...\". so i\\'m just awkwardly hugging him and i ask if i can kiss him, because i was feeling very confused. he says \"i don\\'t think that\\'s a good idea, but if you want\". and that turns into making out and sex. and right after we finished having sex, he left (but i know he had to leave at a certain time, and after sex, it happened to be that time).so here i am now. non-stop crying for the past few days. not hungry at all. feeling miserable. wanting my boyfriend back more than anything in the world. not sure what to even do. i texted him yesterday telling him all of my feelings and regrets and such and he replies with \"let me sit on this so i can come up with a response\" and he hasn\\'t replied since. every second feels like forever and i\\'m drowning in my own feelings. what should i do?',\n",

       " \"at the moment i'm [27f] dealing with a separation.. and in retrospect i'm not sure what to believe about our relationship since the words that came out of his [29m] mouth were different from his actions. i remember those happy days constantly when he had decided he wanted us to share our lives together, how we bring the best out of each other (we both stopped doing drugs together) and not live without each other and he would commit to me and wait for me to move together only to tell me days later after that proposal that he doesn't know why he said what he had said and wasn't in love with me after all..  he's moving to a different state tomorrow and right now i'm probably going through a denial phase.. he said before he doesn't play games but he also said before that he chooses to commit to me..... :/ maybe at one point he really had been in love with me and again, was just scared of it not working out since there has to be a separation. his family and friends need him back home. but my brother-in-law is right.. it didn't mean we had to break up, he could've waited for me and still want to pursue what we had and continue.on top of that.. an ex decides to hit me up. my ex [25m], believes its ok to talk/treat me like we are seeing each other again only for the moment being while the girl he had met overseas is back home. he'll then change the way he talks/treats me again once their relationship is back on. for a second i felt like that was my worth..... someone to pass the time with. and i write this as i try to resist drugs another day (shrooms, cocaine, acid)again. i had been choosing drugs over my initial vice. i'm bulimic. i am 2 months sober to this day from drugs but i'm back on binging and purging.. i know i need to take better care of myself. and no i do not believe i need a man. but it sucks no less to feel this way. i gave more respect, patience, understanding and tlc to them than i gave myself. i need to work on that i know....\",\n",

       " 'hello, everyone! thank you for taking the time to read this. i just felt the need to vent about my personal issues. pardon me for the typos that i made — english is not my first language, and talking about my emotions is not something i\\'m used to. any how, here\\'s my story. me and my boyfriend have been together for three months now, and so far our relationship has been pretty great and tight. he\\'s very kind-hearted and a gentleman; i love him dearly; with that said, i\\'m still finding it hard to believe that i was able to get with a guy like him. as for me, i\\'m an emotional mess, though ever since we became a thing i\\'ve learned to cope with stress and intense sadness a little better. his presence just relaxes me and makes me feel secured. needless to say, he deserves someone else better. i\\'m so dependent on him; i feel needy of his attention and affection when he\\'s not around and he\\'s aware of this. i try to control my negative feelings and self-destructive tendencies whenever i get this way and he\\'s not here with me — sometimes it would go well; other times i would just end up fantasizing about him abandoning me and me killing myself.  we both have talked about my issues and how they can negatively impact our relationship in the future, however he\\'s very stubborn and still refuses to leave me. i\\'m afraid a time will come when i\\'d bring him down with my negativity and sadness. i think he\\'s a great guy, and i don\\'t want to restrict him from doing the things he would enjoy doing if i weren\\'t like this and he weren\\'t taking care of me. he tells me that he\\'s living for me now — for my happiness — and that i shouldn\\'t care about him, nor worry about him. hearing him tell me these things always make me anxious and concerned for his emotional well-being. i want to make him happy, too, i want to care for him, just be a proper girlfriend. i feel guilty being with him because it makes me feel like as though i\\'m only taking advantage of his kind and caring personality. we are trying to work this out. whenever i get one of my \"depressive\" episodes and feel like shutting him out, he refuses to back away and would encourage me to talk it out with him. when that doesn\\'t work, he just tries to make me laugh. i suppose the crux of the matter here is i don\\'t want to limit my boyfriend from achieving what he could achieve in this life, but at the same time i don\\'t want him to leave me. i wish my feeling this way would just end already.

       " 'my baby boy, boomer, was diagnosed with cancer (osteosarcoma) in august. they said he wouldn\\'t have much time and to just make the most out of what was left, so i did. this past week or so, his bad days outnumbered the good. over the 3 days before i took him in, he slept basically all day and stopped greeting me at the door (except his last day where he slept right in front of the door) when i\\'d come home from work. that day, he didnt eat or drink anything and slept all day. i decided it was time and i originally planned to wait a couple days until my next day off work, but my mom and i both decided it would be best to not make him suffer any longer and that we would take him to the vet in the morning. i slept next to him on the floor that night.i had a nightmare things went wrong, that he wasn\\'t ready. the first sign that i should just wait a little longer.when i woke up in the morning, boomer had perked up a bit. he was sitting up, he went outside and drank some water. when i went to my room to get ready, he cried thinking i was leaving him. when i grabbed his leash, his little stub of a tail wagged so fast, he was so excited. sign #2 that maybe i should wait until my next day off work to do this. my mom called the vet down the road to give them a heads up, but they said they had a bunch of majors come in and we wouldn\\'t be able to see a doctor for a few hours. sign #3 that this was not the day to go though with this. my mom ended up calling the vet she takes her dog to, 40 minutes away, and they said they\\'d get us right in. so, we got his favorite blankets and pillow, loaded up in the car, and left. i laid in the back of the suv with boomer the whole way.when we arrived, my mom went inside to let them know we were there and i took boomer to a patch of grass with a tree to let him go potty one last time. he went, and then took a little longer just sniffing the grass. i didn\\'t mind waiting. he could take as much time as he needed. then we went in.the doctor looked over boomer and said his color and heart looked good. his leg was massive from the tumor, though. the vet assumed he probably fractured the bone, which would explain why it got so big so fast this past week. she said that the next place the cancer would spread would be to his chest. she explained we could get some xrays done, decide from there, maybe come back in a week and they\\'d be sure to send us home with more pain meds for him if we\\'d like. sign #4 that maybe waiting a bit longer is the better decision. we decided, why put him through another week of pain? we should just do this now and not look back.it was as if boomer understood every word. he was always that way, i swear he was part human. he looked at us like \"don\\'t i get a say in this???\" and walked to the door, asking to leave. sign #5 that boomer is not ready for this. then, they came in to begin the procedure. this ended up being the most traumatic experience of both boomer and my entire fucking lives. he fought so fucking hard. it took 3 different sedatives to get him down enough just so they could give him the euthanasia. the 6th and final sign that i need to back out and do this another day should have been seeing the way he reacted to the first sedative...but i allowed it to continue.every time they gave him a sedative, he screamed, and it was like the room was spinning for him, he kept cocking his head back and forth between me, my mom, and the door, he was shaking, he tried to stand up but couldn\\'t, he drooled all over me and eventually couldn\\'t put his tongue in his mouth to the point my pants were soaked. after somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour, he was down, with his nose pressed against my leg breathing me in. for some reason, they had to move him to give him the euthanasia, so they dragged his body a little bit away from me. i moved back up behind him, but what i should have done was go around in front of him so he could actually see me, because even though i was right behind him, he was numb and couldn\\'t feel me. he was laying there, terrified, trapped inside his own body not knowing what was happening. he ended up dying with his eyes open staring at a wall.i truly believe boomer suffered more in those 2 hours than he did throughout his whole life. it shouldn\\'t have ended like that. all i wanted was to avoid him being scared at the end, but he was terrified the whole time and it just breaks my heart. he died absolutely terrified, staring at a white wall. i let him down when he needed me the most. i wanted to be the last thing he saw, but he died with his eyes open, numb and unable to move, with me sitting behind him out of view. that hurts so fucking bad and no matter how hard i try to distract myself and make myself think of other things, i can\\'t stop that scene from playing over and over in my head. he didn\\'t deserve that. no one deserves to die like that.i just wanted my face to be the last thing he saw, not some fucking wall. i didn\\'t want him to die scared and alone.it\\'s just so fucking hard. i keep going over and curling up under his blankets, but i can already tell they\\'re beginning to lose his smell because i\\'m all over them, and i don\\'t want to lose the only part of him i have left. i keep going between crying and numb and trying to sleep. he didn\\'t deserve any of this. he was so good to me and no matter what i did in that room, i couldn\\'t comfort him. it hurts so bad.i know this was a long and painful post, so if anyone managed to read this, i want you to know i truly appreciate you. if you need a tl;dr, just read the title, i suppose.i hope you\\'re at peace now, boomer. i am so, so sorry for everything. i miss and love you infinitely.',\n",

to barely pass this time, graced by the teachers. he thinks he has made some friends, but turns out the only one that believed so was him.he keeps growing angry.he snaps. does a lot of things he doesn't really want to do, and gets locked up in an asylum for a lil' while, a week or so. they treat him like some sort of fucking monster, and his mother spreads out to everyone what her kid just did and why he was locked up.when he gets out, he's just spent.they put him on therapy, medicines and two doctors that only mock him and really don't care as long as they're paid.he snaps again, quieter this time, and stops it all. he keeps on failing at school, he's alone every time. he keeps on playing games not because he likes it, but because they take his mind off the pain. he doesn't want to play that much, but he doesn't want to stop and think.he gets to the 4th year of his 5yrs school. he lies, says he needs a better pc for school, and he builds a desktop gaming one. most importantly, he lies to himself. his laptop breaks down, so it didn't really come all for naught.depression starts to hit harder and harder, and he doesn't want to get out of his house anymore. he doesn't go to school. he fails another year.his parents are mad. go to school or get out of here and start working, you failure, they say. he begs for another chance, and they give him one. he starts school at september of this year. his class is terrible, he feels like they loathe him. he talks barely and sometimes needs to go to the bathroom to cry one or two minutes, then wash his face and say he's been feeling sleepy, insomnia. it's a fucking lie.he's already this close to fucking up this year, too. he has done a great deal of absences, both for real sicknesses and for depression. he's going to fail, he knows.now the kid is in bed. he's tired, but he can't sleep. he's crying too much.he wakes up and goes to reddit, and starts writing some bullshit to try and fucking digitally scream something.tomorrow, the kid will open his eyes and regret it immediately after, asking himself why a gas leak or something didn't grant him the blessing of dying in his sleep.tomorrow, he will look at his hands and see that he has accomplished nothing in this 6 years. nothing.tomorrow, he will look at the mirror and will see that slightly overweight, hateful, disgusting face he tries so desperately not to see. too bad the mirror is right in front of his bed.tomorrow, he'll see a couple on the streets and will ask himself if he'll ever find someone to fully dedicate himself to. if that someone will ever come to love a wretched thing like him.tomorrow, he'll go to school and leave yet another paper blank. he will put up a fake smile, a fake laugh, his stupid persona and then cry in the bathroom, careful not to be heard.he will walk headphones over his ears and eyes to the ground, because he can't stand being watched. he is too ugly and fucking disgusting, so he hides under his hoodie and presses on.tomorrow, he will dream he finds the courage, grows the proverbial pairs, to pick up a gun and press the trigger. then he wakes up, he's still at school, but he slept only 3 hours last night, too busy crying and staring at the ceiling. so he lies yet again, tells the tears are because he's sleepy, that he's fine, he just had a bit of insomnia.today, he dreams there won't be a tomorrow. tomorrow, he’ll hope not to dream anymore.(sorry for this long mess. the kid's too tired. he just wanted to scream something. also, english isn't the primary language of the kid, so forgive him for any error.)\",\n",
       " 'i’ve avoided my parents as long as i can remember. the expectations the set made me think if i wasn’t doing perfect than i wasn’t worth a damn. that’s pretty much the entirety of my mind in a nutshell. three weeks ago they uncovered my avoidance and lies and i broke down in front of them. my mom did the exact same thing she always does “you need to do this” “you should do that” “this is what’s going to fix you”. for the first time in my whole life my dad didn’t do anything like that. he didn’t claim he understood my situation, he didn’t claim to have any insight, he just told me how he dealt with the things he dealt with. never once did he say the same things would work for me, just listed ideas of things that helped him. he treated me like an adult. he didn’t tell me what is right, he just tried to help me figure it out for myself. he treated me with respect even while i bawled my eyes out.that week i started taking care of myself better. i kept schedules, i saw a therapist, i kept in touch with people. my therapist and i started talking about what caused the change, what triggered the shift. i’ve never in my life had a heart-to-heart with my dad, and when i did suggest things to do together they became his things to do with my help, not things we did together. this weekend i’m gonna tell him how much he matters to me, i’m gonna bring a project to him and we’re gonna do it right this time. i’m gonna undo the ideas i’ve built up in my head about my dad and rebuild them with him. i’m so scared, for so long i’ve just tried to avoid him, never really get to know him. but i’m so hopeful too. for the first time i feel like i’ll be able to change the way i see things. it seems irrational, but i feel like confronting this will finally put an end to the anxiety, avoidance, and feeling of uselessness. i don’t know how this sounds, but for the first time i feel like i can turn things around, make things right. it’s terrifying, but there’s nothing i hope for more.',\n",

       " \"i wanted to share a story with you. one with a (hopefully) happy end. (i shortened it a lot) even though it is not my story (mine is rather uninteresting; just the usual shit...) it is the story of a good friend. let's call him luke for now.i first met luke in elementary school. he moved from a town to my village with his mother. his parents just got divorced. i think he broke back then. i remember him hiding in the closet crying, or sleeping while class. it was at an age where i didn't even knew what depressions was, or what it could do to people. nevertheless, he was the cool kid. the center of the room he was in. and i got to be friends with him! me the antisocial skinny nerd that at the time had read more books then the whole class combined. i looked up to him. we finished elementary and moved on to different levels of school but stayed in touch with each other as we soon began to build up a gaming squad, which changed some members over time but we kept gaming! sometimes heavy e-sport sometimes casual fun. he got less invested in school and got a way better gamer then i was at the time. i think that he dropped out of middle school with 14. his depression had finally catched up with him. after dropping out of school he stayed at home. he eventually was diagnosed with depression. i got worse. he was on a lot of drugs. he mostly kept his mouth shut about the times when he was in the psychiatry. but sometimes, when it got really late, he would talk about it. how they strapped him onto his bed and sedated him. how he flew into the night, with only his trousers on. i don't think that helped much. what helped him was one guy who played cards with him in the psychiatry. such a simple thing but he pointed it out multiple times throughout our conversations. i think that the simple act of kindness and caring of this guy helped him through this horrible time. it eventually got a little better over time. at that time his family had kind of given up on him. the mother had to care about two other children too. he went to a boarding school and i only got to see/hear him at certain weekends when he was home. i took him a while and a lot of willpower but he finishes his education now. from what i hear, he has got a gf (still single yay) and finally moves on. what i am trying to say is: no matter how deep you fall: you can raise again! i know that you are strong enough! there are people (not only in this sub) that want to support you! and even if they live hundreds of miles away; we care about you, and you should too!and i am sorry about my horrible english as i am from germany :)\",\n",
       " \"*extremely long post, apologies in advance*boyfriend and i have been in a long distance relationship for the last year and a half and we both suffer from depression, anxiety, have had traumatic experiences and at times have had less than stellar support from our families. last year his grandfather who he adored passed away, a student tried to file a false report against him singling the kid out (which was dismissed), and his work was weighing down on him. on my end i was struggling at work and hit a major depressive episode after being raped and was dealing with my divorce which my ex filed without having the courtesy to notify me and allow me time to prepare.at times these things weighed down on our relationship, and he would shut down and just become completely unresponsive, but ultimately we were able to work through it all. it was never really a fight, and at the end of the day we'd always wind up happily back together.and when we visited each other things were always great. my friends, my family, everyone loved him. and although we haven't had the opportunity to do the introduction with his folks they said they're happy to see him with someone that genuinely seems to care about him. he wanted to move down here, even though i offered to move on my end as well. he said he's just happier down here and feels like he could have a better life.ultimately he is my best friend, the love of my life, and the only person i can picture growing old with and navigating life with. i've never really had a good relationship prior to him and i've never had someone support me as much as he does, be it emotionally or artistically. he's stated he feels all the same things i do, and i do my best to support him in every way possible. everything about what we have is what i've been looking for my whole life.\\xa0i met him by chance through a friend while i was married and although nothing ever happened, i knew the moment i met him he was special. my heart jumped out of my chest, i got tongue tied, and i couldn't be in the same room without turning bright red. he was hilarious, brilliant, handsome, and we shared so many similar interests. i went to go see him every day i could and even after he went back home with my friend to help her move back north, all i could think about was how i wish i had just run away to be with him. i couldn't get him off my mind for months. but im about 11 years younger so i thought he just saw me as some goofy kid. (i'm 27, he's 38)fast forward to my divorce, i was devastated and was blindsided by my ex husband's decision to leave. around valentine's day my now boyfriend reached out to just send me a bunch of cheesy old valentine's to try to cheer me up and we began talking. we both confessed how attracted we were to each other and began talking every day. but due to the distance and being freaked out from the divorce i was a little afraid to jump into things, so i dated around at first but i never stopped talking to him.i had guys develop feelings for me, but ended them because i couldn't love them back. at the end of the day my heart wanted him. then that summer he came to visit for a whole week and it was the time of our lives.everything is great. there's no jealousy, we respect each other, we enjoy every second of time we spend together, we support each other in seeing friends, we support and inspire each other artistically, and we genuinely value each other's opinions. it is by far the most fulfilling relationship either of us have had even though it's a 9 hour drive between us.the problemhe lives about 670 miles north of me and suffers from seasonal depression and works as a teacher dealing with some very underprivileged kids.\\xa0where i live it's sunny all day almost every day, so i don't really experience seasonal depression issues.something happened at work last month and he began to shut down on me again and when he finally talked he explained something happened at work with a kid trying to attack coworkers and he had to restrain the child. something about the situation really disturbed him and that while although he's decided he needs to get counseling, he's afraid he won't be able to give me what he thinks i need anymore and that although it's hurting him to do so he wants to go on break until he works on himself.i explained that while i understand that he's hurting right now i don't want to just leave him behind, and that i'll still be here. he then told me how much he loved me and that he really appreciated me sticking by him. for the next few days he seemed to be improving.then the holidays hit, and i'm not sure if it was seeing his family with his grandfather not being there, or what happened, but he shut down again. he wasn't ready to talk about it, so i just told him i loved him and if he wants to discuss it i'm here for him.after that i just would send him a message to let him know i love him and that he has my support no matter what. then one day i wake up to find out he's blocked me without a word or any hint that anything was wrong. i was devastated, but knowing he was dealing with stuff i've tried to be understanding.it's been 3 weeks now since i last heard from him and i know i may have had some missteps on my end of handling the situation, and i may have been overbearing the last time i reached out to him, but i'm extremely worried about him and really hurt.none of our mutual friends have heard anything and they all say this is very odd for him. i have full faith in him and i don't think he's cheating, and i know he loves me. i've come to accept the fact that this might be it and that i might never hear from him again, and there's no way i can force him to be with me, but i'm not ready to just turn my back on him.\\xa0i've got his christmas gifts here, and i'm not sure if i should just continue to give him space, or if i should send them. i know better than to send a long emotional letter with it,and that he might not accept it all together. i'm just hoping sending him a little card wishing him a good holiday, with the gifts to just let him know i'm still here and thinking of him.at the end of the day, i know i can't fix what's wrong with him. but he's my best friend and my true love and if things do end, i don't know if i could accept them ending like this. if he left me because he found happiness elsewhere that would be one thing, but if this is the end, knowing that he's hurting makes it even harder because i know he still loves me.i'm finding it really hard to just move forward with day to day life. i'm still trying to emotionally recover from being raped last year, and now there's just a giant gaping hole in my heart. i don't need him to be happy, but i've never felt this way about anyone before. i know there's no right or wrong answer for these things but i just hope i'm taking the right steps instead of pushing him even further away.\",\n",

       " \"i was with this guy from uni briefly for only a month or two last march, but the best two months of my life. it was a whirlwind, we spent every moment we could together, we were compatible in every way, same humour, same opinions, amazing sex, we'd stay up for hours telling each other things we'd never told anyone. we were crazy about each other.he went away for 5 months on an exchange programme and we stayed in touch, saying how much we missed each other and how much our time together had meant to us. we got back together when he came back and it felt amazing to be reunited, even better than before. he constantly told me how lucky he felt, how incredible i was, how good i was for him.i fell in love with him. yesterday morning he showed up at my dorm hysterical, broke down and said he became depressed while he was away (i had no idea, he's only just admitted it to himself) and that he didn't have feelings for me. he thought being with me would make him happy but he couldn't feel the way he wanted to, he was just going through the motions. he said i was perfect for him, everything he wanted, the best person he'd ever met, he really liked me but saw me as a friend and no more. he's had moments of happiness when we were together but otherwise he only felt numb, and had constant anxiety about how he felt or didn't feel. he said when we first met he thinks he was happy because he wasn't depressed then, but he can't remember much. he promised he would get help and asked me not to contact him so we could both move on because we 'can't make each other happy'. he was incredibly upset and remorseful but left before i had a chance to process it. i'm absolutely heartbroken and so confused, we were making plans for a holiday in january (his idea) and nothing ever indicated he had doubts.so my question is for people who have experienced anhedonia with depression, could it prevent romantic feelings from developing or stop you from being able to feel them? do they ever come back? everything was perfect before he left, when he came back depressed it changed. or am i idealising this and would he still know if he liked me, anhedonia or not? thank you for your help.\",\n",

       " 'more like, the people on that site.you see, i’m fully aware of how asshole-ish i might come off in this. but the great thing about reddit is that no one knows me on here, so it’s not like the people i’ll refer to in this post can track me down (if you guys are reading this, i apologize, and you can yell at me privately or something). i want to tell it as it is. no holding back.(i’m seriously afraid no one will even believe me, or that this is just some sort of fucked up product of my mind. but i don’t think i imagined these two years. it all happened. all behind a tiny screen.)((and i’m sorry if this violates any rules of this subreddit or anything. i guess i’m just trying to evaluate what went wrong, and how my mind has changed. i’m not really certain. if this post needs to be deleted, then so be it.)i joined this app in hopes of.. wanting to get away. you see, a couple months before, some friends had gotten me in trouble with the police (long story short, they lied about something huge and it got my family involved). things were never the same since. i was homeschooled. my family and i grew distant from each other. i just felt alone. then i came across that app. i created a superhero-based fan page, one may call it, then it branched out into some sort of multifandom shit. i enjoyed being on that site. i enjoyed being able to share what i loved. i made a few friends on there. everything was amazing. i felt amazing.but i was still struggling. and it was noticeable. i blame this on myself. i wish i had kept my private life completely private. i wish i hadn’t spoken a single thing about me. a few months later, another account contacted me, telling me stuff like “if you want to talk, i’m here for you” and so forth. of course they sounded like a nice person. of course they were nice.and they were. (i’ll call this person dave for now. no offense to any dave’s, but this is a spur in the moment decision and i cannot refer to this person by his actual name.) dave and i became close friends. he called me his best friend on many occasions. he helped me through so much in my life. when my parents divorced, he was there. when i felt lonely, he was there. when i was being bullied, he was there. when i felt like shit, he was there.he was always there. and my first mistake on that app was thinking i owed my whole life to him. he became my life. everything i did was for him. everything. i loved him. and i think he knew that, all this time. he said he loved me back.(i know what you’re thinking. “why did your dumb ass trust a person on the internet?” i want to remind you that he and i were both practically children. not 12 or shit, no. but we were young and stupid, and not all people on the internet are pedophilic predators. but this isn’t the point of the story.)i don’t think he meant it on a romantic level, of course. but i did. every time. i’m not sure if he really loved me, whether it was as a sibling or friend or more. i’m not sure of anything at this point. but all i know was that i loved him to the point where i would die for him.and i did. i had attempted suicide before, and he was there to comfort me, and even talk me out of it. he was a good friend. but one day, something happened. he tried to commit suicide, as well. he was suddenly so angry at everything and everyone. he snapped at me. then he apologized and left. he made a post about wanting to die, and didn’t respond. not to my texts (at this point, we had exchanged numbers. for our safety, he said. just in case.) i panicked. he didn’t respond for hours. and in the heat of the moment, i tried to die, too. i remember thinking that i wouldn’t be able to live without him. i was so, so stupid and naïve. then when he came back, i hadn’t. because i had another attempt. i didn’t return for hours. he was waiting for me when i came back. and he was angry. he never tried to commit suicide. he didn’t even make a post, he claimed. i remember my heart dropping. i remember it so clearly. i remember his anger. his cursing and endless uses of the words “fuck” (fuck you, what the fuck, you are fucking stupid). i thought it was because he was worried at the time, but it... wasn’t.he was angry because i would have taken away the “glory of his death.”people were worried about me more so than him. he wanted people to worry. in that post— which was, in fact, real— he talked about how “people didn’t care about him” and etc. i felt like shit after our argument. it was one of the first arguments we’d have in the months to follow. he began to be more expressive. he’d openly talk about his problems online, as if it was a competition. he’d comment things on other people’s posts that showed a hint of depression, “at least your dad doesn’t...” “at least you don’t have to...” “at least you aren’t failing in...”over and over he’d say this to people. i was safe for a while. he’d continue to help me. we had a larger group of friends. i felt happy, but at the same time, deep down, i felt broken and lost. like i knew something was wrong, but i didn’t have the heart to say anything. he’d always tell me things like, “if i ever go too far, you can keep me in line. i’ll do the same for you.” but whenever people pointed out something in his behavior, he’d lash out. and i’d be his dog. i would lash out at them, too, for upsetting him even in the slightest. i’d excuse his actions with, “he’s going through a rough time. be more considerate of who you’re speaking to.” this became very expected of me. and i hate myself for ever letting it happen.yes, he was in fact going through a rough time. his father wasn’t the best person, and he was failing in school, all while he was trying to earn some money by working every saturday. he was tired and stressed, and i was just some “rich fucking kid who shouldn’t complain” (as he’s told me later on).dave grew more angry by the day. he was angry at everything. and soon, he’d be angry at me, too. he said he was tired of me, wondering why i can’t just take his advice and get better. he’d be angry at me for not waking up on time to talk to him (he was est, i was pst; i woke up at 4am every morning, including weekends, to talk to him and keep him company, because he felt alone and “no one was ever there even if he’s there for them.”) i kept apologizing, spamming apologies while at the same time trying to keep myself from having panic attacks. he was my friend, and i couldn’t lose him. i wouldn’t have anybody left. besides, i loved him with all my heart.soon enough, i couldn’t take it. i decided to lie about going into a hospital to treat my anorexia. (something i was actually going through at the time.) he said, and i recall, “okay.”it was my chance to kill myself. again. and so i tried. and i ended up in an actual hospital for more than a week. when i came back, it was as if i hadn’t even left. but what upset me the most was, “maybe you’ll be a better person, now.”i knew what he meant. “maybe you won’t be such a depressing bitch, now.” i stayed silent and thanked him. turns out during that time, he grew closer to my friends. i was a little jealous, i have to admit. partially my fault. i was still completely in love with him. but one day, someone messaged me a screenshot of a message between two of my best friends.friend: “no offense, but i’m getting tired of her... (me.)”dave: “same. she’s a toxic fucking person.”friend: “yeah....”dave: “every time she talks she’s always whining.... she doesn’t realize that other people have worse problems... sometimes i wish she’d just go already. i’m so fucking tired of her. (and he continued to complain about my behavior.)”i think that fucked me up after a while. i was too scared to confront either of them, really. so instead i withdrew myself. they noticed and got angry. i didn’t explain myself.then more shit happened one summer. i lost a friend to suicide. i lost a cousin to an accidental overdose. i was kicked out of my house for a month. i was sexually assaulted by several people. i grew distant from dave and my other friends. i tried talking about what was happening in my life to dave. but it was merely dismissed. i stopped being supportive of him, because i was tired of being angry at people who angered him. i was tired of receiving one word responses and aggressive messages about how i’m no help to his situation. i was tired of the fights. i was tired of still hopelessly loving him, even through everything.i still owed him my life.i was so, so tired of it all. and i hated myself for all of it.i decided to leave for a week without saying anything. i received a message on another social media site from him. he proceeded to yell at me for hours. he called me a bad person. a toxic person. an abusive friend. he said i was never a friend. he asked why i faked my suicide. i said i didn’t fake it. i was only procrastinating (an asshole response on my part). he blocked me. we never spoke again.to this day, i still receive messages from my former friend about dave. she yells at me, too. yells at me about anonymous accounts now angry at dave, blaming him for making me leave that app. i tried stopping those accounts, still. even after everything. they eventually died down. but i’m still blamed for dave being bullied. i’m blamed for dave being depressed and wanting to kill himself (which he told me before i left, that *i* was the reason for him wanting to die). some fucked up part of me still loves him and blames myself for fucking up our friendship. another part of me promises to be a better and more careful person next time. not sure what i’m even planning on doing anymore.i don’t know why i’m still alive, to be honest. i’ve made new friends, but i’m still very distant from them. i don’t know who i can trust. my parents don’t even know about what happened for those two years. today, i try to move on from all that shit that happened. i go to school. i make music. i write. i draw. i read. i have depression. i have anxiety. i have psychotic symptoms. i self harm. or, i used to. i am recovering from an eating disorder. i am a rape survivor. i feel like i’m hanging on tightly, still. i’m not sure why, but i am. i’m not sure if i should keep holding on anymore. but i want to. life is hell. life is tragic. life is chaos. but the little hopeful things— from the stranger who played their guitar for me when they saw i was upset one morning, to my dog running over to me, happily and without much thought, when i arrive home— have shown me that life can be beautiful.i don’t deserve life.

       " 'this is my first reddit post so i’m sorry if i’m not doing it correctly. i have a huge long story but i’m going to keep it as short as possible. so i dated this guy for about a year. it was an ldr. he is from europe and i from america. this guy discovers not long into the relationship that i was struggling with some depression. he spends the entire rest of our relationship trying to fix it, or me, or whatever. basically he tried to at least control it. we were ok enough to the point where he wanted to meet me. at this point with me things kind of fell out with me because 1. we argued more and more about the depression. he actually claimed it would be easier to handle if we could just meet. and 2. to be quite frank with you i don’t think it was a safe or a smart decision for an 18 year old girl who has never left home to fly on a plan for the first time to meet someone she’s never met, alone. i had to tell my mom. my mother was very worried for obvious reasons and kept a lock down on me and wouldn’t let me go. which i was most definitely ok with. i know that you should take risks in life but with us not really heading in the most candy-land based direction with constant arguments about how i was depressed and not doing things correctly i just was so uninterested. it felt like he just wanted to change me. i didn’t like him anymore. wasn’t attracted anymore. i felt i was being held down and i was just about to go onto college, so i took the opportunity of not flying off on this trip to erase him from my life. i stoped talking to him. he went on the trip anyway despite my warning to him that i could not go. this is harsh, i know. but i was already trying to tell him that i was not interested anymore. again he was just assuming the depression in me was just pushing away help. the way i saw it, us meeting was far more work than i thought being with someone else could be. and that i could be much happier with someone else. i was terrified by the thought of flying somewhere by myself and being with someone that i no longer trusted. fast forward to a year later, i am a sophomore in college. i have had a boyfriend for a couple months. i decide to try to clear things up and fix things. i want to apologize to europe boy and tell him that what i did to him was really shitty. i message him. i tell him that i want a natural no-stress conversation (i was quite traumatized by his attempts to “snap” the depression out of me. he would get mad and threaten to post my photos and my name and address everywhere.. and he still does to this day.). he says ok. i also tell him that i messaged to be able to make things right again and give us piece of mind. i tell him that i was also starting to get a little busy due to finals. he knows that school is about the most important thing to me at this point in time of my life. he still gets mad at me to this day for “stalling”. perhaps i am, but i procrastinate anyway, and as previously stated my exams are top priority. i understand that i should have waited until i had more free time to message him. he still claims i am depressed (i may be uninformed but yes i do have depression but there are times when it gets worse and better, and other than last month i feel pretty damn good about my life). he still wants me to talk to him to make things right again. like full talking again. but it has to be done a certain way. and there’s nothing i can’t stand more than this guy telling me that what i think about myself is wrong. for example, he is telling me that i am in denial, even though i do tell him that i realize that i have depression, i just don’t feel depressed at the time. i mean, do we ever even fully overcome depression? is that possible? idk. i’m pretty happy dealing with it and having my new boyfriend by my side. anyway. fast forward about a month more, i am literally in love. i have never loved someone more. our relationship is so perfect. i message europe boy again. (november was a bad month for me so little to no communication.. my dog passed away and my grandmas cancer no longer shrinking..) i tell him that i need to tell him this information (about my being in love) now, because he still carries on as if he can still “fix” my depression. and sort of leads on that that means a future together. and i do not want him to think that i still want to be with him. he refused to let me tell him the information. i think he has an idea, but idk. fast forward again to last night. europe boy messaged me for 3 hours straight as i am studying for a final that i had today. i felt like shit. talking to him made my face hurt. my eyebrows were in constant furrowed shape. to be honest with you, i feel like he is the embodiment of my depression. everytime i talk to him i am depressed. i shut down. i can’t even communicate with him very well because of it. which makes for an even longer and more complicated conversation. and doesn’t make him think that i am getting better. i cannot stand it anymore. i want to be done. i can’t get rid of him. the year without him was so blissful. i feel like i really found myself. he says he doesn’t know who i am anymore. i’m not who i was. but to me i think that i am better. i feel bad for what i did to him but there’s only so many times that i can apologize and honestly what kind of apology is good enough for what i did? any one that i give him he is unhappy with. it is not good enough, and i know that. i don’t know what would be good enough. but it’s not like i want to bring him back into my life again. i only messaged to try to make amends. but i have done much worse. i wish i had left him alone. his whole year without me he said he just felt like shit. he says i wrecked his life. he says i come back and i make it worse still. i didnt do this out of malice. i did not mean to make him feel this way. i simply hoped/thought he would move on. but i guess i underestimated his care. he says that i am humiliating him and scolds me when i ask simple questions or just try to have him see my point of view. he disregards everything i say unless it’s in agreement with what he says. i know this because when i only respond  with “yeah” and “okay”, really small sheep messages, he’s fine. the moment i question him or do not agree he’s pissed. he threatens to kill him self. says i really fucked him up. and sometimes threatens to leave all my information behind so that i will have blame.i dont know what to do anymore. i just want to be rid of this. i have more stress in my life than i already want to handle. this two year nightmare needs to end for both of us. i could really use some advice. please. i know this is a pretty vague story missing lots of details but any amount of different opinion helps. thank you guys.',\n",

       " 'i don\\'t care if anyone reads this or not i just need a safe space to vent my thoughts and feelings.  i don\\'t even know where to start i\\'ve been stuffing things down and suppressing so much for so long that i\\'m finding it difficult to think with clarity and articulate myself clearly. i\\'ve tried to pinpoint when exactly it was i started to feel like i was in a haze, lost, out of touch with myself. it seems i could trace it back to a little over a year ago. i had ended a relationship with a \"former\" drug addict and harbored a lot of resentment to him. my reasons for dating him weren\\'t that great either. i felt like i was a little bit better than him. that i would be some kind of prize. so i went for him. i thought i could be the best girlfriend ever. mold him into my perfect man. love him into changing. surely i would be worth it. well the next 5 years proved to be futile. i was constantly disappointed, let down, resentful. i felt guilty for being angry with him because i was the one that chose to be with him. i couldn\\'t really blame anyone but myself. there was a lot wrong with that relationship but one of the most frustrating things was our sex life. i felt it was non existent. he didn\\'t have much of a drive and he was also a bit repressed. deep down, i craved intimacy, depth, sexual liberation, exploration. i fantasized constantly about the sexual experiences i wanted to have or do again. this eventually turned into me watching a lot of porn and taking care of my own needs. we eventually broke up over his addiction but still remained \"friends\".  soon after that i took a trip overseas and ended up binge drinking one night and hooking up with someone. i barely remember it but from what i do recall i was enjoying myself quite a bit. when i finally came too. i ended up calling him and telling him about it. he was angry. i knew he would be. although we weren\\'t technically together. we still shared intimacy and i felt guilty. i also felt relived in some way too. like finally i did something that would end this relationship once and for all. no back and forth. i also liked that freedom in knowing i could explore my sexuality again. i was free to choose. no more consigning myself to porn and masturbation. i could do the things i desired. when i returned home we talked in person and he was quite angry and hurt. but also wanted to continue having a relationship. i on the other hand felt like i was done.  since it had been so long since i had been part of the dating world i sort of stepped back into that stuff with little steps. perhaps not the smartest things but i did what i felt comfortable with.  i was scared of getting out there and meeting people. afraid of diseases, people playing games. but i was tired of my porn and solo masturbation. i ended up using things like whisper app to sext anonymous people. using phone chat lines to have anymous phone sex.  i wasn\\'t necessarily content with this but at the time it was fun and it felt (somewhat) safe. eventually i met someone on the whisper app that was a bit different. i was drinking one night, i was alone, feeling horny. i got on the app and asked if someone wanted to \"clean\" skype. i ended getting a response with some guy overseas. i was intrigued and after messaging him for a bit it was clear that we were both in a very sexual mood. we made a skype phone call and started talking. i was a bit more comfortable than i normally would\\'ve been because of the alcohol. so i quickly revealed my fantasies and the kind of sex i liked and wanted. i asked if i could call him daddy. his response was \"of course, baby girl\". i remember feeling this huge sigh of relief and losing myself in the daddy fantasy and he was right there with me. it was amazing. i should say that i\\'ve always had this kink. i never knew much about it in the context of bdsm. but it was always something i wanted to indulge in. anyway it was clear that he really like my kink and we continued talking for the next few hours and then again the next day, and the day after. i felt like we were just having fun, enjoying this mutual kink. he then asked me about more of my fantasies, the things i liked, kinky and non-kinky. he told me about some of his fantasies. he even asked if i would like for daddy to give me some tasks. i said yes. feeling intrigued, and excited. this was different. he told me to send him greeting texts everyday and to send picture of my underwear. i thought maybe that\\'s too much. i even brought that up with him. he told me only to do it if i was comfortable but that daddy would really appreciate it.  later on in that same skype he asked me to get a marker and write i belong to daddy on my chest. i did it and thought. i guess that\\'s kind of hot, but is it a bit much? i kept that thought to myself. i was enjoying this close attention so much. he really seemed to like that. he even said he didn\\'t take that lightly. again another thing that i thought seemed a bit strong. but i liked it. he started saying things like you like belonging to someone . you like being daddy\\'s property. he then asked how i was feeling, what i was thinking. i said i felt good. although i was also feeling a bit odd. trying to understand what was happening. was this a game? was this real? what was it? i continued sending pictures and greeting texts. we skyped again. he asked about that writing on myself. saying he hoped to see it again. i was confused. i didn\\'t want to write on myself with a marker everyday. he looked hurt, but asked if there was something else i would enjoy doing more. he said he wasn\\'t upset with me but was trying to understand how i think. i couldn\\'t help but to feel like i let him down. he said what just happened was normal. that it was ok and we could figure something else to do that i may enjoy more. this interaction was like nothing i\\'d ever experienced before. it was all so new. later on the day i was thinking about him, missing him, wanting to be close to him.i took a pen. went into the bathroom stall at work, pulled up my shirt and wrote \"i belong to daddy\" on my chest. i took a picture and sent it to him. he was overjoyed saying he felt like my \"true daddy dom\" i felt amazing too. like something finally clicked. that writing on myself felt like some kind of link to him. something only he and i knew about, something i did for only him. from then on i write that on myself everyday. i loved knowing it was there. i felt this connection to him despite the distance. i loved what i was feeling. i also started feeling like i would do more and more for him.it was great for a little while but then i noticed things starting to change. he wasn\\'t as quick to respond. his messages weren\\'t as inquisitive. he seemed to be hurried more. i eventually asked him about this and told him that we could stop this thing we had. that i was grateful for the experience but i didn\\'t want to drag things out and do them out of obligation. he agreed, \"released me\", and said i could reach out any time. for about 2 days after that i felt ok. like it was all worth it. and that i learned something very important about myself. but then this withdrawal feeling started to kick in. what now? i want a comforting daddy. i missed tasks and being a good girl. i missed the sift and firm contrast of his presence. i felt like i was on the brink of some intense self discovery and then it came to a screeching halt. i felt crushed. i reached out to him asking about what i should do now. he gave me some general sounding response about being adaptable. i thanked him for his response but was disappointed. again a few days passed and more thoughts flooded my mind. i want to submit again. i want to continue this. if not with him, with someone. how do i navigate from here?what\\'s happening? i reached out to him again. this time he never responded. i felt completely destroyed. angry at myself, like a fool. i thought he was better than that. i thought he would tell me if he didn\\'t want to talk. i certainly didn\\'t think he was the type to ghost. but that\\'s exactly what he did. the next few weeks i dealt with depression, confusion and thus new hunger in me that couldn\\'t seem to satisfy. i spent hours googling and reading about ddlg, bdsm, and kink. i eventually found fetlife and very quickly got into the personals in there. looking for my next \"daddy\" it wasn\\'t the smartest move but i wanted it so bad. i also know i wanted a pleasant distraction from my pain.eventually i met some people on there that were nice and tried to offer a little guidance. they explained i was having a sort of \"sub frenzy\". they encouraged me to attend a munch in my local community. i did that and enjoyed it somewhat but still had a bit of anxiety.   i still couldn\\'t shake that feeling either. that hunger. i eventually tried to meet someone off fetlife with the same kink. online it was ok and then we finally did meet and i wasnt attracted to him. i also didn\\'t feel the chemistry in the flesh. he respected that, was very kind and we decided to go our separate ways. i was back at square one. feeling empty, hungry, confused, hurt. i eventually got back on that whisper app and started messaging someone, the of course sexting like before. i also called him daddy because i liked too. but it wasn\\'t deep. it wasn\\'t like the last time. he just thought i was being kinky i was but i was also satisfying that hunger a bit albeit a very little bit but it was better than nothing. than out of nowhere that foreign guy \"daddy\" messages me, saying \"hey\". i was relived, happy, and angry all at once. i told him how i was feeling how i was just starting to accept the fact that he didn\\'t want to talk to me. to see me. he said he was sorry and that he was also sorry for reaching out. but i said it was ok. i missed him. i wanted to cling to him. we eventually started talking again. sexting and having naught chats. but this time it was different. there were no more tasks. i didn\\'t call him daddy and he was much more rough this time around. wanting to humiliate and degrade me. i tried to go along with it because i wanted to keep him but i couldn\\'t. i couldn\\'t trust that he wouldn\\'t disappear again. i couldn\\'t let go and submit like before. i told him this and he seemed to admire and respect what i told him. i was feeling like i had a bit of closure and that i was finally able to put him behind me. but this desire to submit. this longing for daddy never went away. i eventually tried dating locally and met someone that seemed interesting and who was into my kink. upon reflection there were things i noticed about this person that didn\\'t quite sit right with me but i minimized those feelings and pursued them anyway.  i was so desperate to get my \"fix\". this is where things get heavy and  i start losing myself. this is where the guilt and shame come in. i used this man. i used him to project my fantasy onto. i called him daddy and was submissive to him but pretty much guided the whole thing. as much as i wanted daddy i was voracious and wanted explore my sexuality and this kinky world i had discovered. i tried to be really honest with him about this part but realized he would feel hurt and emotionally react when i brought up this truth. eventually i quit sharing everything. i started second guessing what would say. censoring myself so i wouldn\\'t have to deal with his emotional reactions. this relationship was one that im still trying to clear the fog surrounding it. it was amazing and beautiful in some ways but painful, and confusing in other ways. he hurt me but i know i hurt him.  with this man i really bonded. i showed him so much of myself and he showed me so much of himself. i still miss him but feel in some ways he is not good for me. i don\\'t know. i think i\\'ll continue writing this later. i feel spent as of right now. thanks to anyone that reads this.',\n",

       " \"i guess i'll start with an in-a-nutshell version of why i think things are like they are. i've had depression, i think, since around the age of twelve. at this time, i had a baby brother and a newborn sister and things were pretty difficult. my mother and stepfather didn't have much money and living with two babies was, quite frankly, hell. my uncle- g- came to live with us when i was about 14, after the death of his father from pancreatic cancer. he was 21. he had to sleep in my room when i wasn't there, and it was hard for everyone because i saw him as lazy/ messy and probably didn't fully understand that he was grieving and depressed, and we had little to no money and he ate quite a lot of our food. my grandmother (his mother) was an extremely selfish person. she fucked up all of her kids through neglect/ selfishness, and she treated him like a friend rather than her son, taking him out of school to go shopping with her, etc. when his father disappeared to ireland in a drug and alcohol fuelled suicide mission, she took him with her, even though he would have been a young boy, and he saw everything. she also moved him to spain with her and his father just before he was due to sit his gcses. consequently, he didn't have any. g moved out about six months later because he'd stolen some money for cigarettes off my stepdad, who was understandably extremely angry as we were struggling for money anyway. he went to live with my aunt until he moved out to live with his girlfriend, t. my mother still secretly provided him with money when he needed it. my great-grandmother died in the autumn of the next year, prompting my selfish grandmother to come back. she took money off her disabled brother, and was generally just a bitch, but he was always on her side. then her brother- g's uncle, p- died suddenly from complications relating to his disability. my great-grandad, who had cared for p and his recently deceased wife (who had early onset alzheimer's), was beginning to succumb to alzheimer's too. my grandmother was already discussing what to do with his money when he kicked the bucket, even though he wasn't yet dying.i wasn't at the funeral, but there was a huge fight, instigated by my grandmother, resulting in physical violence between her and my mother (her daughter). my mother came home covered in bruises. g. was upset at the fighting, but ultimately sided with his mother. i sided with mine, knowing what my gran was like, and sent my gran a message, warning her to stay away from my family (and in particular, my young siblings, whom she'd called 'ugly'). my mother panicked and asked me to block her, hoping the message wouldn't go through. it did, and g. messaged me, telling me that my gran said thanks for the message. this is the last time i spoke to him, as my mother requested that i block him too.a year later, he meets c., and leaves t. the night he meets her, some asian men allegedly call her a slag for what she was wearing, and a fight ensues between g and the men. both him and the men are hospitalised. he initially tells my mother that he'd had an accident on his bike, but she received a phone call some weeks later from him. he tells her the truth and explains that the police are after him, and asks my mother for money to flee to spain. she refuses, but offers to take him to the police station and give him any money he requires either for bail or to live, and reassures him that he won't go to jail as it's just a stupid case of men assaulting each other. he declines, and runs away to spain, having found the money elsewhere. the relationship between c. and g. is volatile. they fight constantly in spain, and end up deciding to come back to the uk anyway after some months. my grandmother informs the police that g. is arriving back in the uk.g. blames my mother for this, and sends her a text. he claims that it's her fault that he's spent the night in a cell, and that he no longer views her as his sister. he also claims that c. is expecting a baby, but that my mother and aunt will not be a part of their life, whereas my gran will.at the time, we all shrug at this. my gran was not maternal and was not a good grandmother either, so the idea that she'd suddenly be a good grandmother to his child is laughable. we decide that what he needs is time and space to grow up.unbeknownst to us, c. was expecting triplets, and miscarries. this, coupled with his father's death, sends g into a spiral of suicidal depression at xmas 2014. he attempts suicide by trying to jump out of their student house roof window, but is detained by the police under the mental health act and sectioned. he is assessed by a doctor, who puts his behavior down to 'grief', and is released. he is given anti-psychotic medication.neither his mother or us are aware of this.11 months later, c. gives birth to a son. g. seems immensely proud, and appears, from what i have seen after, to have been a good father.however, c. and g.'s relationship is still volatile- and the police have apparently been called to them before.they have an argument on christmas night, allegedly after the baby rolls off g. whilst he was sleeping. c. hears this over the baby monitor and they argue. she is unclear about what happened next- she initially said that he went straight out, but then changed the story to him going back to bed and her waking him up to argue with him again. regardless, g. loses it, and leaves the house. an ambulance is called for the baby, though he is not actually hurt. g. goes to a footbridge not far from their home. c. texts him frantically, asking him to come back, but he tells her that he's going away, for her safety and for the family. at about 3:05 am, he jumps off the bridge and goes through the windscreen of a passing van. he dies instantly.i hear about this when i'm woken by my crying mother on boxing morning. we go to see his body. a few days later, we see c. and the baby. after the funeral, she changes her version of events, alleging he was violent, gives a statement to the police alleging he was sexually abused as a child, and cuts off all contact with us. we still don't have contact with her or the baby.this will be 2 years ago this christmas, but i still can't get past it. my concentration on anything has gone to shit, although i moved from my home university to a new one an hour away for a fresh start. but i can't cope with academic writing or study, and i'm failing miserably.my mother calls me lazy, and i feel utterly worthless. i've got decent a level grades (a*cc), but i just can't hack university at all. my self esteem is extremely low, and depression renders me unable to get out of bed most days. somehow, i just feel everything going to shit and i can't stop it. depression and my grief for my uncle's suicide has driven most of my friends away, and i can't seem to make friends at uni either.what do?tl;dr: my uncle committed suicide violently 2 yrs ago, i've got chronic depression, and i'm failing miserably at university. what can i do?\",\n",

       " 'over a month ago, my ex slept with me knowing i loved him and he promised that he wouldn\\'t disappear and that he wasn\\'t just around to fuck me. (i have trust issues because he has done a lot of things to hurt me emotionally in the past- like talking about extremely personal things about me behind my back and then when i confronted him saying something like \"well, it\\'s been a trip. have a nice life.\", blocking, and ignoring me- he eventually apologized months later but got a bit pissed off when i tried to talk through it and express my anger and hurt over what had happened). it was heavily implied that he loved me before we slept together, and even when we spent time together that day. we had talked for weeks beforehand and he had asked me to come over twice that week, and had made plans to go to a movie with me soon also. and then after the first time we saw each other again and slept with each other he told me he didn\\'t feel anything but friendship feelings (and that he didn\\'t know i felt that way, but i am 110% sure that isn\\'t true) he said we could still be friends and reassured me again he wouldn\\'t go anywhere. fast forward to now, he has completely ignored me for weeks, and i got frustrated and upset that he would hurt me so badly like that when he knew how much i loved him and how i had pretty bad depression and after we had had a heart to heart (while cuddling after he had slept with me) about our suicidal thoughts we sometimes had (so i figured he wouldn\\'t hurt me again since he opened up so much and acted like he cared). so i messaged him and basically told him how cold he was and how messed up it was to try and gain my trust again and then repeatedly promise that he\\'d never just abandon me, and then do exactly that immediately after. and i also said that it would have saved a lot of time if he had just told me to jump off a bridge to begin with. i feel kinda bad. i don\\'t want him to feel bad, i just got upset cause i want him to care. i love him so much and i\\'ve given him the benefit of the doubt so many times because i loved him and believed that he was good. i still think deep down he\\'s good, which hurts even more because it makes me love him more than i would if i hated his guts. i love him so much it hurts. i don\\'t want to live without him. i don\\'t want to live if he doesn\\'t care.aside from that there was a couple other traumatic things that happened on just that day (even more stuff happened in the past when we were together). he was really aggressive when we made love the second go, after we had sex the first time i was sore and i didn\\'t want to do it anymore, but he started touching me and i kept saying no over and over, but eventually i got aroused and gave up. but idk maybe my tone wasn\\'t serious enough, and i had told him at some point that among the fantasies i had i also had non-consent fantasies sometimes, and he didn\\'t physically force me, he just kept touching me when i said no. so i\\'m not about to call it rape or anything like that. it still fucking hurts though. i would\\'ve assumed after the first no he\\'d be like \"no as in yes or no as in no?\", but that was not the case. (and i\\'m pretty sure while we were still dating i discussed with him that if we ever did anything super kinky like that we\\'d need a safeword). i didn\\'t mention anything to him about it cause i don\\'t know how serious my nos sounded so i don\\'t want to blame him if i wasn\\'t clear enough. i kinda wish i did talk to him about it though, so he\\'d know what i\\'m going through.i feel so worthless, stupid, needy, and pathetic. i\\'m also very frustrated because i have only one friend that i\\'m not that close with, (i\\'ve been chronically ill for years with an unknown illness, so i haven\\'t been to school enough because i\\'m so exhausted, so i haven\\'t made any new friends since middle school.), so the only people i really have to talk about my issues with is my mom, my sister, my dad and my therapist, and i\\'m only comfortable talking to my mom and therapist, but i\\'ve talked to them so much about how i\\'ve felt regarding him for the last month or two that i feel like they\\'re annoyed to listen to it anymore. i really really want to kill myself. it fucking hurts so much that the person i love so much cares so little of me that they\\'d do that. that i\\'m so ugly and unlovable that i couldn\\'t keep someone around for more than a week or two after they see me. i don\\'t have any friends to talk to and i\\'m flunking the only class i\\'m still in. i just feel like such a failure and that any potential i had has been squashed by both me and my chronic illness, and that i\\'m just a loser with no friends that won\\'t ever be able to find anyone that loves me for anything more than my heavily done up appearance. i try to have hope that things will get better, we have a new lead on what could be causing the debilitating mystery illness, so maybe that will help. but what i want most is a friend that really cares about me.idk for me it really helps to talk about the relationship and all of the bad shit, if i don\\'t talk about it enough i start to miss him a lot. just answering questions about it and getting confirmation that i\\'m not to blame and that the things he did to me were fucked has helped a couple of times. or just questions about anything in general. (i have lots of trauma to talk out). it feels a bit better for people to know what he did, because it feels like i\\'m the only person in the world that knows (no one in his family or friend group knows) and everyone thinks he\\'s great so in my mind it\\'s almost the same as if it had never happened at all.i just need to talk through some of it and remember more of the bad stuff so i hopefully won\\'t love him as much. and if anyone has my advice on how to feel better and less devastatingly upset and depressed and blaming myself that would be rad too. sorry for rambling, thanks.',\n",

(i am aware that this is my problem, not his, i am not asking you to help me change him; i am asking to help me make him understand what i mean.)some background information. my boyfriend and i have been dating for almost a year and due to things coming together in a weird way we already moved in together. my boyfriend is a (slightly autistic) gamer who is quite hard to get out of his \"comfort zone.\" things he doesn\\'t want to do, he just doesn\\'t do. because that\\'s \"who he is.\" this is also the case with saying nice things to me. he doesn\\'t like doing that; so he doesn\\'t. i mean i know he must like me because he is still with me, and we moved in together. i just don\\'t get why he likes me. i have been struggling with a severe depression and to say it bluntly; don\\'t like anything about myself. so i don\\'t understand anyone would like me. i feel like i need the reassurance once in a while that i am good enough for him and that he does like to be with me. when i bring this up and say; i just want to know you like me; he\\'ll say he does. i\\'ll ask him why and he\\'ll say something along he lines of \\'love you\\' and hug me. which is really cute. but then i\\'ll ask him; but why. hoping to hear that there is a reason he likes me. but he doesn\\'t understand what  i mean and he\\'ll say \\'because i do.\" part of it i think is him genuinely not understanding: part of him is just done with the conversation. he\\'ll say it makes him feel awkward to say nice things and so he doesn\\'t want to. when i don\\'t bring it up he won\\'t say he likes me. so issue one for me is; he\\'ll always say he likes me when asked; but not \\'randomly\\' which makes me feel like he just wants the conversation to end and he doesn\\'t really like me. issue two is that i genuinely hate myself and i don\\'t understand why anyone would like me. when i ask him \"but why?\" he\\'ll eventually come up with; because i like it when we watch tv together. which for me is a result of liking me: you like someone so you watch tv together. not a reason to like someone. i know he must love me; i just don\\'t feel loved in the relationship. does this make any sense to anyone? if yes: please tell me so i don\\'t feel as crazy. and if you could help me rephrase so he gets what i mean i would forever be thankful. it\\'s up to him what to do with that afterwards of course, but i don\\'t want things to go bad because we are simply not understanding each other. end of rant. thank you! tldr; boyfriend of insecure girl doesn\\'t understand what she wants of him in reassurance.

       " 'my “ex” fiancée was having a hard time and it was getting to the both of us. i told him he could go ahead and leave. he then started bawling and begging me to “stop him from leaving”. i stayed away cause he called me some names and i wasn’t up for anymore name calling from his end so i just locked myself in the bathroom to get away. so for two hours he keeps begging and i say please go i don’t care what you do. he then says “you know i love you”. and i said “then stay and stick this out cause i don’t get to run away but you can”. so then i start begging like he wanted. i look up and all of a sudden he’s saying “let me go” and he wants to leave. i’m finally doing what he wants and he switches up suddenly. then i keep trying for ten minutes at most cause it’s what he wanted, and i see he’s recording me. and i ask if he’s recording me and he says it’s for his protection. so i let go quickly and realize that that was a very strong line he crossed. it made no sense what was happening. am i wrong for feeling like the recording he started doing was wrong? when he was the one that begged for me to stop him from leaving?

       " 'i have this ex that i was with for about 4 months. it was short but it was intense, both in a good and bad way. we were very much alike; we\\'re both crippled with depression, with unhealthy coping mechanisms (games, too much sleep, smoking, etc). we\\'ve never met each other, but we talk and play everyday. it ended fast exactly because of us being alike. we were toxic for each other. when one of us is having an episode, none of us know how to handle the other person. we only amplify the bad things in each other. we were technically together for 4 months but i started falling out of love during the 2nd month. our relationship only did us both worse.we\\'re actually not that much alike in terms of status, socially and financially. he wasn\\'t able to finish school and no one in his family gives a fuck about him. i was also his only friend. i, on the other hand, am not wealthy but i can have a job if i want to. i have a mom that cares deeply about me, and a few friends whom i can trust.i found someone new shortly after our break-up. he is a smart, loving, and wonderful person. i found myself gradually getting better each day. he was very patient and careful whenever my anger bursts out of a sudden, he holds me tight whenever i\\'m having panic attacks, and he loves me for who i am.my ex got worse after knowing that i\\'m with someone else. i check his social accounts from time to time, and all i see and read are angry, depressed words. it\\'s common to think that you should cut ties with your ex to help them move on, and that\\'s what i was initially trying to do, but he kept talking to me and asking for friendship because he literally has no other friend than me. all i wanted then was for him to get better after everything i put him through, so i tried my best to keep the friendship without triggering his feelings about me being with someone else. it was really, really hard. it came to a point where he was sending me self-loathing messages, blaming himself for what happened to us. he did this every day. until i decided to really end our communication, for both our sake.his birthday came, and i sent him a greeting. he thanked me, and we started casually talking. he mentioned that he tried to kill himself through narcotic overdose (not so casual now). he was in the hospital for 2 weeks and when he came home, 7 of his cats are dead because no one took care of them, and his sister (who paid for his hospital bills) began to constantly bawl at him for being pathetic and inconsiderate. his mom (who\\'s now with another family) heard of the news too but didn\\'t do anything about it. didn\\'t even talk to him and asked why he attempted to kill himself.after hearing these from him, i felt really worried and tried to rekindle the friendship, again. just so he could have someone to talk to. he told me that he was then starting to accept what happened to us, and that what he did was cause by depression in general.however, days later he started talking a lot, inviting me to play video games every night. i was extremely busy with work, and have problems of my own and i wasn\\'t able to talk much to people except my boyfriend, mom, and around 2 close friends. his messages were all marked \\'read\\'. then he sent me a long message saying he was \"trying to be as casual as possible but i was always putting meaning to it and was constantly avoiding him\". i told him then that i was not deliberately avoiding him and that i was just really busy and a few repetitive exchanges after i finally snapped and told him that he can\\'t just demand things from me all the time. i have a life to live, too, after all. this caused him to hate himself again and even more, the last message he ever sent was \"i should really be out of anyone\\'s life\".i was too angry then to try and be patient and calm. weeks passed and no communication, until i visited one of his accounts to check on him. i read that he is trying to end his life for good on november 12. it was november 5 then when i saw it. i didn\\'t know what to do but i ended up sending a fairly long message--not necessarily stopping him but just thank yous and sorrys and telling him that if he decides to stay longer, i would wish his life happiness and that i would be happy too if that comes true.he never got to read the message. it\\'s been 10 days and he hasn\\'t seen my message. i checked all of his accounts and he had been long inactive. that might be it. he might\\'ve ended his life earlier than november 12.i feel altogether guilt, regret, frustration, and sadness.i wish i was more patient. i wish i did more. even when it was fair that i got mad, i wish i tried to adjust, since i am the stronger one. i wish he stayed longer. even though i couldn\\'t give him the better life he deserved, i wish he stayed a bit more. what if something better had happened the day after he died? or is it better that he \"finally found peace\" now? i\\'m really torn about suicide for i\\'ve had my fair share of attempts before, too.i don\\'t even know if i have the right to feel sad because i\\'m one of the reasons this happened.i don\\'t know. my brain is just so fucked up right now.update: still no online activity from him.

       " 'long story short... home is a bad place for me. parents are verbally abusive, neglectful, and occasionally physically abusive (not enough that cps would do anything about it though) and i encountered a lot of physical, sexual, and verbal abuse from people outside of the home so i have pretty bad trauma. i started taking dance last year and for the first time, made friends. like, real ones. for the first time. and my dance teacher gave me all these amazing opportunities! i even got to meet bill clinton at one of our performances together. slowly, he became the father i always wanted. he knows about my family to an extent and i have gone to him and received comfort in coping with my sexual abuse related trauma. there’s some other people back home that are pretty great too, but it’s not as relevant to the story. just know that i have bit of a support system who kind of knows how bad my situation is, so they can kind of understand why i act the way i do. i met a boy this summer, and i won’t say his name because he uses reddit and i’m kinda terrified that he will read this... but just know, he was amazing. you see, when you are as traumatized as i am, especially from sexual abuse, no matter how good you are at concealing it in every day life, it 100% shows through in relationships. because of this, i made a few mistakes in behavior that i simply cannot control because of what i’ve been through. anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, sexual abuse, self harm, a shitty family... it weighs on you. and looking back on all the telltale signs i displayed to him makes me very very sad. but he saw them, and he didn’t look down on me. he was one of the most remarkable beings i’ve ever met. how can a boy be that mature and understanding at 19??!! and when you finally find someone, it fucks everything up because it just emphasizes how bad your trauma and baggage really is.  he was amazing, and completely understanding, but it was too soon and i found it impossible not to show him my past, even though i never told him straight out. he definitely at least figured out a part of it. how could he not when i was visually terrified whenever he got close? or when i screamed and blurted out “i thought you were going to grab my vagina” when he just playfully lunged at me. but that boy... wow. he made it clear that he wasn’t going to hurt me. he told me that in the most loving way, and even started a conversation about what my boundaries are so that he wouldn’t trigger any of my anxiety. he has anxiety too so he gets it. i mean, i’ve had crushes before but this was... real. i can’t explain it, but we got each other. we were only actively speaking for a period of two weeks and then it all went to shit, but in those two weeks, this boy taught me so much and made me see the world in the most wonderful way. i look at my surroundings in a different way because i was blessed with the privilege of spending time with him. i am a better person because he was in my life. if he hadn’t broken my heart, he would’ve been the first to break down my walls. i love him (notice how i didn’t say ”in love.” there’s difference) and will always love him. then he stopped talking to me because he was leaving soon and a few other complicated reasons but it was generally just really sad. it was not because he stopped liking me. we were very much falling for each other.  i never got to say goodbye.i never even kissed him!!! or held his hand. he would’ve been my first kiss. the reason why was because of how terrifying my trauma made this experience. and now he’s thousands of miles away, and i’m in college. we probably won’t talk again for a long long while. when i was in high school, i dreamed of being here, away from my horrible family and all of the people that have hurt me in my town. i even got into an a cappella group!! if i told myself that a few years ago, my younger self would cry happy tears. that was her dream. but you don’t understand, man.it’s not like i thought it would be here. i mean i knew it wouldn’t be perfect, but i didn’t think it would be this lonely.  in the last year back home, between my dance studio, my friends, and this boy, i developed something to miss. while home life was horrendous and made me constantly want to die, i had that escape, and here, i just don’t. all i have are memories and dreams of going back home. and granted, i would much rather be here in college because home is horrible, but there’s just nobody here who i have a deep connection with yet. it’s lonely, and there’s only one person i’ve actually semi-bonded with. but it’s not anything like what i have back home. most other people just make me feel sad because they don’t really care about me.i haven’t self harmed in over two weeks, which is huge for me!!! but the thing is, it’s really hard not to because the people that i used to not self harm for are miles and miles away and honestly, they don’t answer my calls as much as i wish they did. not all of them, but a good portion.  my dance teacher is horrible at replying. he cares, but he’s just doing a shitty job at staying in touch. i will talk to him about it when i get back home, but right now, i’m just hurting a lot. keep in mind, i see him as my father, and to have close to zero contact with him breaks me. the first boy who ever made me feel safe is in a different country and doesn’t want to talk to me, my dance teacher doesn’t answer me that  much, and the vast majority of people i talk to here regard me as a last option. it’s lonely. i’m honestly just very very depressed and suicidal. that’s been a common thing ever since i even knew what suicide was as a child, but it’s worsening again. i’m reverting back into old ways because it feels like all of my life before senior year... with little to no people who even remotely cared. sometimes, i can’t even count the amount of times i think of killing myself in a day because i simply constantly have the urge. like, every second. this isn’t even scratching the surface of everything. i’m trying to be brief but there’s just so much. any love would be appreciated. i really could use a hug right about now.

       " 'i\\'m a 18 year old bi male who has a friend who i\\'ve pretty recently developed feelings for.we met last year in my art class. for many months it was just us talking about things like video games, anime, tv shows, stuff like that.after summer vacation, i\\'m assigned to a first hour class with him. it\\'s largely stayed the same but something was different. something that was so minuscule i don\\'t even know what changed. over the weeks, we slowly started talking more comfortably to each other and after a couple weeks i got his twitter (big step for me, i can barely talk to people) and for a good week we simply talked about things we would normally talk about over dms after school.it\\'s important to note at this point i started noticing i had butterflies developing. so, i very very gently started making moves. he\\'s an extrovert and i\\'m introvert so i don\\'t think the moves were obvious though. however, i\\'m not sure because he does seem to flirt with me a lot (he\\'s bi too) but it was casual flirting, if that makes sense.for the past couple weeks ive had the butterflies bad. it\\'s to the point where i wake up and literally one of the first things i think of is him. i couldn\\'t hold back anymore so last night i decided to make a move.after some casual talk about various stuff, i got the courage to say he means a whole lot more to me than he knows. he began asking \"emotionally?\" in which i reply \"a little\" (i couldn\\'t get the courage to say how much) in which he seems to have taken it pretty well so far. we didn\\'t talk about it much though after that short moment though. we went back to talking about casual stuff.he didn\\'t show up to school today which is why i have the time to write this. but i have no doubt when he comes back he\\'s gonna use this as ammunition to embarass me, as he usually calls me things along the lines of adorable and it usually flusters me, but i do like it.i say \"kind of confessed\" since i\\'m not entirely sure it was a secret. i don\\'t think he\\'s that dense to not have noticed it before last night. but idk, i\\'m both scared for tomorrow and hopeful when he comes back.oh boy here we go.',\n",

to write down what is happening, to think it through. i\\'m struggling, and this is going to be a long-winded post. please be kind. my mother died 2 years ago. her illness (brain tumour) struck her suddenly, and she deteriorated very severely very fast, which was devastating to see. after she died, i ended up cooling my contact with the rest of my family because i had serious issues with the behaviour of a few individuals around my mother as she declined so rapidly (i won\\'t go into it here.) as you can imagine, this whole episode left me pretty horrendously depressed.there was a problem though; i didn\\'t know i was depressed. i knew i was sad for mum, but that gave way after a while to this.... deadened feeling. i kept as busy as i could be at work, so i barely noticed (i\\'ve since realised that planning/organising is my coping/avoidance mechanism.) i didn\\'t feel sad at all, but i didn\\'t feel happy either. the primary emotion i remember feeling the last few years is sheer boredom. impatience. anger at my family for their beyond shoddy behaviour. disinterest with what i had previously loved. but i didn\\'t feel sad. my former so and i had always been very close. teenage sweethearts. my parents, and mum especially, *loved* him (his parents and i had a more fraught relationship, but that\\'s another post.) but over the last few years, we drifted apart, and lost our emotional intimacy. i take full responsibility for this, as i should have noticed the destructive behaviour patterns i was falling into (constantly signing up for more work, compulsively watching television without really enjoying it when i wasn\\'t working, not paying him more attention or giving him affection, arguing with him - generally freezing him out.) i am so full of regret about this now, so angry with myself for not realising and for not doing more for him. it wasn\\'t all horrendous the last few years, but yeah, i neglected us. i had begun to improve in my mental state the last few months, and maybe because i was more receptive, i noticed how much things had cooled between us. i asked him frankly what was the matter, why he felt so distant to me. he told me he still loved me, but not in the same way anymore - i\\'m his best friend, someone he loved very much. just not romantically.at first, we spent a few days talking about what we should do in a cautiously optimistic way, he literally went from one day saying he wanted to try and make it work, to the next saying flatly that it wasn\\'t going to work. it was like being hit by a truck. i still don\\'t know why he turned so sharply from one path to the other, especially when he had always been so dedicated and enthusiastic about us for all these years. i have some suspicions but nothing solid.i agreed to move out. i told him that i wanted to make it work, but i moved out, arranged to live somewhere else, signed a lease. we met up for a coffee to discuss how things were going to go. i wore a dress i\\'d just bought. he was largely distant and polite, but he also told me that when he saw me he immediately noticed how nice i looked, with a sad tone to his voice. he later messaged me to thank me for meeting him, that i was really good company, and that our time together that day felt like how it used to be. but he told me also that he was still set on staying separated, didn\\'t even want to say \"never say never,\" and that while maybe we could have worked out our problems, that we had begun talking about it openly had ensured that we couldn\\'t fix it (a sentiment i vehemently disagree with, though i didn\\'t say anything to him.)a few days later, after seriously looking to bulk buy temazepam online so i didn\\'t have to get up in the morning anymore, i went over to pack a suitcase. i had reached a better place in myself, was beginning to accept my life\\'s sudden change of course. i\\'d had a good day at work, and while i was still broken-hearted, i seemed a lot better, to others and myself. i went into the flat with a brisk attitude, a plan to pack as quickly and good-naturedly as possible. as i did, he came in and watched me silently. he looked increasingly distressed. eventually, he broke down in tears, sobbing desperately, apologising profusely, telling me he did what he thought was best. he kept crying the entire time i was there. he told me he didn\\'t want to ask me to stay or to reverse the decision, as he didn\\'t know if he was just so sad because he was so depressed about the relationship ending, or because he really was regretting the breakup. he\\'s terrified of being alone. he too struggles with depression, has a habit of bottling things up and enslaving himself to a routine. he\\'s on anti-depressants and is finally attending a therapist. he\\'s had problems with his mental health for years, but his parents are incredibly negative about mental health and so he was discouraged from getting help for a very long time. after staying far longer than i intended, despite his obvious distress at how \"real\" it suddenly all is, he still asks for help in decoupling all the accounts/putting the bills in his name. i sit on the bus back running over how heartbroken he seemed, his constant apologising, and his final comment about changing the bills over to his name, to show how he was committed to the path he\\'d chosen. perhaps it was a bad idea, but i wrote him a letter, paper and ink, when i got home. i posted it the next day. in it i told him how iced over i had been. how much i love him, how i forgot to tell him. how sorry i was. i asked him if we could just slow down. that all the decisions we\\'ve been taking were far too immediate and dramatic. i assured him that i would be fine, whatever happened, that i was fine in my new place. which is true, to an extent. i had a difficult upbringing, and i\\'m tough, and adaptable (though this whole saga has revealed how vulnerable i really am.) before my letter reaches him, i have to go back to his to pick something up. when i\\'m there, i need a bag to put things in. he hands me one, that i later at home realise has things he needs. we arrange for him to pick it up from me after i finish work, but he cancels, telling me he\\'s not able as he\\'s in a bad place. he\\'s received my letter, he later tells me. he is sad to see my half of the room cleared of my things, it\\'s hard for him to see. he doesn\\'t get upset with the idea that i might go out with someone else, but does find it weird. he tells me everything is up in the air and uncertain. over the next week, he messages me a lot. he sees i\\'m up early and asks me why. he tells me he\\'s struggling a lot. he calls me a few times and cries. he has no one else to talk to. i try to be understanding. i accept the phone calls for a few days but i\\'m hurting. i\\'m confused. i eventually ask him why. i get angry. i tell him how he betrayed me and i don\\'t know what he wants. what does he want from me? why can\\'t he change his feelings back?i feel bad. i ring him later, to apologise for how intense i got. we talk. he tells me that he doesn\\'t want to invite me back home because he doesn\\'t know why he wants me there. that his feelings change every 15 minutes. he was certain that he knew we should be apart and that he was happy with that outcome, but then he\\'d see me or talk to me. because of that, he\\'s not going to try to reconcile. he wants to understand why he is so devastated, why he is terrified about being alone. this is fine with me. i always knew he felt very intensely about us, to an extent you might describe as \"clingy.\" except i loved him too, so it didn\\'t feel wrong to me. but he needs to mature, get better. i know this. i just wish i could help him.the next time i see him, he is very distant. it hurts but after a shower-crying session, i move on. the next couple of weeks, we have zero contact with each other. i have an incredibly work intensive time, which is nice and distracting. whenever i slow down, though, i get depressed very quickly (and this time i recognise it as depression.) but i realise i need something that is still at his, fairly urgently. i send a very formal e-mail to him, asking when he will be working so i can go in and get everything undisturbed (to my mind, i\\'m on the road to recovery, and seeing him would likely confuse me.) we go back and forth on the e-mail, formally and agreeably. i also ask for some money he owes me, as i am pretty depleted. he eventually tells me that he is seriously struggling for money, to the extent he doesn\\'t think he can keep his place, and that he is in \"a very very bad place.\" i grow concerned again. i offer to meet him for coffee, but he tells me \"this is a disaster of my own making and it\\'s for me to deal with.\" i stand firm. i am worried about him and i have a right to be worried, especially when he tells me he\\'s struggling. perhaps unwisely, i tell him he can call me to talk. he does. we do. he sounds so alone. he tells me he has no one else to talk to. he\\'s drinking too much, which is depleting his money very quickly - he\\'s only been living alone for a month, and he\\'s already into his overdraft (and this is after i lent him money for the utilities. he\\'s always been a little too happy to spend money, and one of our most common arguments was how much our shopping cost, because he\\'d always pick the most expensive, high quality goods.) he starts messaging me again. just a \"hey\" here and there. sometimes i respond, sometimes i don\\'t. on thursday, i go over when he\\'s not there like we arranged. i get the things i need, and take some other stuff back. this includes a statue of mary that belonged to my mother, that was in our hall. he loved the statue, but i want it back with me. i miss her, and all that has happened has revealed to me how little i have recognised how big the gap in my life is. it\\'s such a difficult time and all i want is my mum. i know he\\'ll notice it missing though. there is something else odd about the visit. on his bedside table, unfolded, is the letter i sent him. the one where i tell him i still love him, that i\\'m happy to wait while he sorts out his head. it looks almost posed, lain out aesthetically next to the bed. it\\'s been a while since i wrote it. i read it, and see if i still feel the same way. i\\'d asked him for the money, as well as for a piece of furniture i brought from my family home, both of which could be read as a communication on my acceptance and readiness to move on. to an extent, they are. i feel conflicted, though, as i read the letter i wrote several weeks ago. if he asked me to come back, would i? maybe not. he messages me a \"hey\" later on, after his shift ends. i suspect it\\'s because he\\'s feeling sad about the statue. i don\\'t respond. the next day, he texts me to ask to meet up to go over the change in name on the internet. i tell him he can do that easily without me. he says thank you and doesn\\'t say anymore. but i do need to get another thing from his place. but i hold off messaging him. i feel sad. i said i\\'d go out with some friends tonight, and one is determined to get me a \"rebound\" guy, to make me feel better. i\\'ve been doing ok, but i\\'m starting to feel confused and sad again. i go out, get drunk, feel panicky when a guy starts flirting with me. i get irritated with my friends and feel cut off from their cheerful exuberance, make excuses to leave but actually go into another club to be alone and drunk and stupid. i had fantasised a bit about being single again, and enjoyed the idea of being free to flirt and kiss and sleep with new men. but now i\\'m here, i feel so miserable. people are rude and strange to talk to, i feel horribly drunk and depressed, and i just wish i had stayed at home. i wish i was back with him most of all. i miss the connection, the sweet familiarity we have. i love him so much. i miss him so much. none of this should be happening. i drink too much. i kiss a guy at random, just to get away from these thoughts, and maybe convince myself that i can enjoy other people. i just feel alone. the next day, i\\'m hungover, exhausted and utterly miserable. i thought i was doing ok. i\\'m not. i\\'m really not ok. i still need the thing from his. i message him, casually asking him how he is and can we meet up so he can hand me the item. he says he\\'s doing better (just as i feel like i\\'ve plummeted down a 50ft jagged rockface. of course i tell him i\\'m doing well.) he\\'s stopped drinking, mainly cos he can\\'t afford to now. he\\'s friendly and polite in his messages. we arrange to meet up and we both say we\\'re looking forward to it.i have a fantasy of how i want this meeting to go. and i know that fantasy is unlikely to be realised. i want to make myself look pretty. i want to be the easygoing, fun and responsive person he fell in love with. but i don\\'t know how. everything went wrong when my mum died. i\\'ve only just begun to realise how devastated it left me. it\\'s not just hurt my relationship with my so, but it\\'s affected so many other areas of my life. but i think it\\'s too late to save the other relationship in my life that matters so much to me.',\n",
       " 'i’m mom to a wonderful son who was  unexpectedly hospitalized for depression and suicidal ideation three days ago. this is the first time anyone in our family has been diagnosed or treated for depression. his dr. has started him on a mild anti-depressant and wants to keep him for 2-4 more days. he has called me begging to be discharged. he says i’m the only one he trusts and he needs to come home. his dad, adult siblings, stepdad, and i are all in shock and only want what is best for our boy. all of us knew he was depressed about a recent break up, but none of us realized he was this unhappy. my question is this:  how do i help him through this? what did you need to know/hear from your family members? how do i safeguard the trusting relationship we have/had if he feels i am betraying him by getting him help he needs? will we ever have the same relationship?the “handbook” i received from the hospital is all about legal and medical regulations and visiting hours (1 hr., 3 days/wk), nothing about what to and not to say to help, and certainly nothing about how to handle the kinds of phone calls i received last night. before i see him tonight (for the first time since he was admitted), what should i know? i’m thankful for any advice you can offer. i hope this is okay to ask here, if not please direct me to the right thread. thank you so much, and i hope everyone on this subreddit finds peace & joy. update: we (mom, dad, stepdad, and brother) all met with kiddo tonight. it went better than i expected and i definitely felt more prepared for this first visit thanks to your responses. kiddo wasn’t happy about not being busted out then and there, but he did seem to accept that we all love him to bits and really will have him discharged as soon as the dr. gives us the green light. long road to go, and the emotions in play are confusing and scary, but tonight felt like we are at least starting from an okay place. hugs.

       " \"this is kind of a long story, but i'll try to sum it up as best i can. he's been struggling with manic depression for around three or four years now. he'll have high periods where he's great for a few weeks, but his low periods are very low and last much, much longer. he hasn't been able to keep a job because of it, and not being able to keep a job has caused him to feel pretty worthless and his self-esteem has plummeted. he tried going to college but couldn't get past the introductory maths because of his discalculia (it's like dyslexia but math), and so that didn't work out either. after sticking it out for a while at one job, he ended up in a mental hospital because he mentioned to his doctor (who he was seeing for depression and anxiety) that he had considered suicide. it was a state-run facility for people who don't have insurance and he was absolutely miserable the week he was there. he's not taking depression medicine now because he said they always make him feel numb and it doesn't help the depression any, and he's not willing to continue trying other depression medicines. he has medicaid (or medicare? i can never remember which is the one for old people and which is the one he has) right now so he's goes to a therapist once a month to get his anxiety medicine and medicine for his adhd, but it is a state mental hospital and they normally deal with drug-rehabilitation so not exactly what he needs... the therapist just gives him hims prescription and tells him to leave, doesn't ask  how the medicine is working and seems very uninterested when he tries to talk about his problems. so tldr: my boyfriend is extremely depressed and he is definitely a suicide risk. he's seeing a shitty therapist right now, but that obviously isn't helping. i think he could probably stand to be sent to a legitimate mental health facility to get his life back together... but because of his experiences with those i feel like he would hate me if i tried to send him to one. i don't know what to do. please  help. \",\n",

       " \"i realized when i woke up this morning that in that hazy state between sleep and waking, i had been having a conversation with myself about not wanting to be with my boyfriend anymore. i remember feeling dread toward being with him, and guilt for feeling that. this scares me, because i don't want to leave him.there have been countless times when in that same sleep-wake state i just feel gushing gratitude and love for him and i wake up with a smile, and feeling this other thing just scares me.my boyfriend (27) has been, for many years (basically his whole life since his teens) a sad and depressive person with suicidal inclinations. he self-harms regularly, but has never attempted suicide, though he speaks of it often. myself (25), i am also sensitive and prone to depression, but after going through the worst of it a few years ago, a bit before i met him, i have resolved to not let myself fall into that pit again and i am generally able to hold a gentle and mildly hopeful outlook on life. being with him has played a big part on me being able to love myself more and his encouragement led me to be able to move out of my emotionally abusive parents' house and i'm doing a lot better living on my own.last year, though, his depression worsened significantly and has caused strain on our relationship. we have been able to manage, but he has so many behaviors that are destructive - when he has an episode where he feels really bad, he refuses to talk to me, sometimes for days. he has curtly and suddenly broken up with me a few times when he has felt particularly hopeless, claiming that he needs to be alone and that he just cannot be close to anyone. each time, we have gotten back together when he starts to feel better and then start talking again. it's always really natural and gentle and we're attracted to each other, and we deeply care for each other. it’s as if, because the relationship itself is mostly a life-affirming and positive thing for him, when he feels self-destructive it’s the first thing he wants to run from.i have learned to deal with his retreating and i have learned to take it a lot less personally than i used to at first. but whereas our relationship has always been a space where we take care of each other, these past few months he has been consistently worse than i have ever seen him and i feel like i’m doing all of the work for the relationship, because he can only deal with himself.there are very tender moments in which he tells me how much he appreciates me being there for him, and often enough we are able to just be together and have a fun time. but i’m starting to feel depleted, from the constant heavy negativity day after day. i feel like it already takes a lot for me to keep up a hopeful outlook for myself, and i have to do it for the both of us. i am starting to resent him for not making a commitment to well-being, but instead just seemingly choosing to suffer day after day.i say seemingly because i do understand that it isn’t really a choice and it’s not as easy as him just choosing not to suffer. he keeps saying that he believes these are the last days of his life, and it will all end soon. i’m worried about him, and also feel powerless to really help.his deepest problem, i think, is his high degree of generalized guilt and horror at the state of the world. he has told me that he feels he cannot be happy if there is even one person somewhere who is starving. i believe he feels he has to shoulder all the suffering of humanity, and perhaps this has something to do with his deep traumas of having been brought up christian by a strict and self-sacrificing father. he has gone to psychoanalytic psychotherapy for years (not going now because of money), and though he says he has found it beneficial, i’m not sure to what extent it’s really helped. i feel he keeps digging stuff up about his childhood and his parents and himself but it doesn’t ever seem to make him really feel better. i personally think medication might help, but he is very averse to the idea.i love him, i don’t want to resent him and i don’t want to start acting weird around him. at work, my hours have temporarily increased and it’s also contributing to my general tiredness because i really need time to zone out by myself and i’m not getting much of it. in a couple of weeks my schedule should be back to normal. i did have a conversation a few days ago with him about how i felt, and he seemed really ashamed and called his own behavior childish. i felt better overall after speaking with him, and he assured me that he had heard and understood me and would make an effort to make me feel more appreciated. he is such a sweet boy, capable of such tenderness, and i love him with all my heart - but this weird apathetic numbness that i feel today, like i said, scares me.if i’ve burnt myself out, how can i help emotionally refresh myself? all this time, i’ve been more or less able to brush off his negativity and tirelessly seek him out to give him support, but maybe i’ve been putting his needs before my own and i let resentment build up without realizing it. i’m not sure. i do want to find a way to balance it out. can i get some encouragement?

       " \"my 23 year old brother has been dealing with depression since high school. he's on a medication (not sure which one) for it, but doesn't seem to be helping much.we grew up in a small town <10k people in the midwest. he's lived there with my parents his entire life. i moved out when i was 18, went to college, then a couple years ago moved to a southern state. i'm 31, so the age gap is fairly significant.anyways, i think the fact that he never moved out of our parents' place, lived in the gloomy midwest, and in a town where there's nothing to do contributed to his depression significantly.i convinced him to move down south with me and my fiance. we live in a larger city ~1 million people and we have 250+ days of sunshine each year. i figured that just the sunlight and more options for things to do should help.he stays in his room all day (starts a job delivering pizzas tomorrow) and alternately sleeps/watches netflix/ plays video games and presumably drinks all night.he's only been here about ten days, but already i can tell he's an alcoholic on top of the depression. i caught him at 4:30am sneaking into our liquor cabinet and had poured an entire straight glass of tequila and he was already stumbling drunk. he started crying when i approached him and said he needed my help. it broke my goddamn heart.i need to figure out how to help him. i don't know if being a hardass on him is the way to go or if there's an alternative approach. i invite him to come with us when we go meet up with friends, but he's just not very social. before moving here, he worked at a pizza place and was considered a very good worker by his boss, who told my parents that he was going to make my brother a manager if he had stayed. so he is motivated to do a good job at work, but outside of that, he just has zero motivation or desire to do anything.i haven't dealt with depression myself, nor do i know of anyone else that has (at least not that has told me about it), so i'm just really having a hard time putting myself in that mindset. he's not very willing to talk about it, so i'm forced to try to come up with my own ways to help him.so i'm coming here in hopes that someone who has battled depression and come out the other end victorious can offer some insight into what helped them. right now my plan is to change the wifi password every day so that he can't use it until he's showered and walked the dog, forcing him to get on a schedule and get some sunlight/outdoor activity. i know that exercise is known to help, so i also would like to get him working out with me, but he's pretty resistant to it. i've locked the liquor cabinet and try to check his room for hidden booze every other day to try to curb the drinking.hopefully the job he starts will make him meet some other people, but other than that, i'm not sure what else to do. \",\n",
